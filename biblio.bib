The resulting problem is nonconvex, and for topology design very large, as one seeks the optimal topology as a subset of a large number of potential bars connecting all nodal points of an initially chosen set. In this paper we present a number of equivalent formulations in the displacements only, taking full advantage of the structure of the optimization problem. The equivalent formulations are of min-max type or are quadratic programming problems in the displacements, reducing in some cases even to linear programming problems.},

Résumé
Nous proposons une méthode de lignes de niveaux pour l'optimisation de la forme de structures élastiques. Notre approche combine la méthode des lignes de niveaux d'Osher et Sethian et la dérivée classique de formes. Bien que cette méthode ne soit pas spécifiquement conçue pour faire de l'optimisation topologique, elle permet très facilement les changements de topologie de la forme d'une structure pour des fonctions objectifs très générales. Son coût en temps de calcul est modéré puisqu'il s'agit d'une méthode numérique de capture de formes sur un maillage eulérien fixe. Pour citer cet article : G. Allaire et al., C. R. Acad. Sci.

We implement this method in two and three space dimensions for a model of linear or nonlinear elasticity. We consider various objective functions with weight and perimeter constraints. The shape derivative is computed by an adjoint method. The cost of our numerical algorithm is moderate since the shape is captured on a ﬁxed Eulerian mesh. Although this method is not speciﬁcally designed for topology optimization, it can easily handle topology changes. However, the resulting optimal shape is strongly dependent on the initial guess.},

For the case of maximization of stiffness for a prescribed volume,this paper presents a new equivalent, an unconstrained and convex minimization problem in displacements only, where the function to be minimized is the sum of terms, each of which is the maximum of two convex,quadratic functions. Existence of solutions is proved, as is the convergence of a nonsmooth steepest descent-type algorithm for solving the topology optimization problem. The algorithm is computationally attractive and has been tested on a large number of examples, some of which are presented.},

The direct dependence of the material properties on its pointwise density is replaced by a regularization of the density ÿeld by the mean of a convolution operator. In this setting it is possible to establish the existence of solutions. Moreover, convergence of an approximation by means of ÿnite elements can be obtained. This is illustrated through some numerical experiments. The ‘ÿltering’ technique is also shown to cope with two important numerical problems in topology optimization, checkerboards and mesh dependent designs. Copyright ? 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Using strut lengths of 7–25mm resulted in a relative density of the lattices ranging from 2\% to 16\%. The lattice elastic stiffness constants and strengths have been characterized under through-thickness compression and in-plane shear as a function of their relative density, and are shown to be well predicted by previously proposed micromechanical models adapted to account for the increased nodal mass and strut separations of the snap-fit lattice design. The Ti–6Al–4V octet-truss lattices exhibit excellent mechanical properties compared to other cellular material – cell topology combinations, and appear to be promising candidates for high temperature applications where a robust mechanical performance is required.},

  abstract = {A methodology for imposing a minimum length scale on structural members in discretized topology optimization problems is described. Nodal variables are implemented as the design variables and are projected onto element space to determine the element volume fractions that traditionally define topology. The projection is made via mesh independent functions that are based upon the minimum length scale. A simple linear projection scheme and a non-linear scheme using a regularized Heaviside step function to achieve nearly 0–1 solutions are examined. The new approach is demonstrated on the minimum compliance problem and the popular SIMP method is used to penalize the stiffness of intermediate volume fraction elements. Solutions are shown to meet user-defined length scale criterion without additional constraints, penalty functions or sensitivity filters. No instances of mesh dependence or checkerboard patterns have been observed. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The proposed method has very flexible geometry modeling capability and represents a substantial improvement of the geometry modeling capability of existing MMC based approaches.

A method is presented which can be used to determine the validity of the substitute problem of fully stressed or simultaneous failure modes design. The equivalence of these two solutions can be demonstrated for a large class of discrete and continuous structures subjected to a single load condition. This equivalence can also be extended to a stress limited determinate truss subjected to several independent mechanical loads. However, it can also be shown that the simultaneous failure modes is not necessarily the minimum weight design for waffle plates subjected to a multiplicity of biaxial loads.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for shape optimization that uses an analytical description of the varying design geometry as the control in the optimization problem. A straightforward filtering technique projects the design geometry onto a fictitious analysis domain to support simplified response and sensitivity analysis. However, the analytical geometry model is referenced directly for all purely geometric calculations. The method thus combines the advantages of direct geometry representations with the simplified analysis procedures that are possible with fictitious domain analysis methods, such as the material distribution methods commonly used in topology optimization. The projected geometry measure converges to the indicator function of the analytical geometry model in the limit of numerical mesh refinement. Consequently, optimal designs obtained with the new method converge to solutions of well-defined continuum optimization problems in the limit of mesh refinement. This property is confirmed in example computations for minimum compliance design of an elastic structure subject to a volume constraint and for minimum volume design subject to a maximum stress constraint.

  abstract = {This article describes a method for the continuum-based topology optimization of structures made of discrete elements. In particular, we examine the optimization of linearly elastic planar structures made of bars of fixed width and semicircular ends. The design space for the optimization consists of the endpoint locations of the bar's medial axes and their out-of-plane thicknesses. To circumvent re-meshing upon design changes, we project the design onto a fixed analysis grid using a differentiable geometry projection that results in a density field indicating the fraction of solid material anywhere in the design space, as in density-based topology optimization methods. The out-of-plane thickness is penalized so that the optimizer is capable of removing bars during the optimization. The differentiability of the projection allows for the computation via the chain rule of design sensitivities of responses of interest, and therefore it allows for the use of robust and efficient gradient-based optimization methods. Notably, this approach makes it easier to fabricate optimal designs by using off-the-shelf stock material. Furthermore, the method considers the case where bars overlap at their joints (i.e. their thicknesses are added at the joint) and when they do not. Finally, our proposed method naturally accommodates the imposition of several fixed length scales. We demonstrate the proposed approach on classical problems of compliance-based topology optimization and identify its benefits as well as research directions to be addressed in the future.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the field of additive manufacturing (AM), often referred to as 3D printing, has seen tremendous growth and radically changed the means by which we describe valid 3D models for production. In particular, it is now conceivable to produce composite structures consisting of smoothly varying oriented anisotropic constitutive materials. In the present work, we propose a sensitivity driven method for the generation of transverse isotropic fiber reinforced structures having smooth spatially varying orientations. Our approach builds upon finite element analysis (FEA) and density-based topology optimization (TO). The local material orientations are formulated as design variables in a stiffness maximization problem, and solved with a non-convex gradient-based optimization scheme. Length-scale control is achieved through the use of filters for regularization. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to handle large-scale 3D problems with synchronous optimization of material densities and orientations yielding millions of design variables on multiple load case scenarios. The method is shown to be compatible with compliant mechanism optimization as well as local volume constraints. Finally, the approach is extended with an additional design variable dictating the ratio of anisotropy for each element, thereby delegating the choice of material type to the optimization scheme.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present an extension of the topology optimization method to include uncertainties during the fabrication of macro, micro and nano structures. More specifically, we consider devices that are manufactured using processes which may result in (uniformly) too thin (eroded) or too thick (dilated) structures compared to the intended topology. Examples are MEMS devices manufactured using etching processes, nano-devices manufactured using e-beam lithography or laser micro-machining and macro structures manufactured using milling processes. In the suggested robust topology optimization approach, under- and over-etching is modelled by image processing-based “erode” and “dilate” operators and the optimization problem is formulated as a worst case design problem. Applications of the method to the design of macro structures for minimum compliance and micro compliant mechanisms show that the method provides manufacturing tolerant designs with little decrease in performance. As a positive side effect the robust design formulation also eliminates the longstanding problem of one-node connected hinges in compliant mechanism design using topology optimization.},

  abstract = {Numerous methods have recently emerged for fabricating cellular lattice structures with unit cells that can be repeated to create 3D space filling systems with very high interconnected pore fractions. These lattice structures possess exceptional mechanical strength resulting in highly efficient load supporting systems when configured as the cores of sandwich panels. These same structures also provide interesting possibilities for cross flow heat exchange. In this scenario, heat is transported from a locally heated facesheet through the lattice structure by conduction and is dissipated by a cross flow that propagates through the low flow resistant pore passages. The combination of efficient thermal conduction along the lattice trusses and low flow resistance through the pore channels results in highly efficient cross flow heat exchange. Recent research is investigating the use of hollow truss structures that enable their simultaneous use as heat pipes which significantly increases the efficiency of heat transport through the lattice and their mechanical strength. The relationships between heat transfer, frictional flow losses and topology of the lattice structure are discussed and opportunities for future developments identified.},

We represent the structural boundary by a level set model that is embedded in a scalar function of a higher dimension. Such level set models are flexible in handling complex topological changes and are concise in describing the boundary shape of the structure. Furthermore, a well-founded mathematical procedure leads to a numerical algorithm that describes a structural optimization as a sequence of motions of the implicit boundaries converging to an optimum solution and satisfying specified constraints. The result is a 3D topology optimization technique that demonstrates outstanding flexibility of handling topological changes, fidelity of boundary representation and degree of automation. We have implemented the algorithm with the use of several robust and efficient numerical techniques of level set methods. The benefit and the advantages of the proposed method are illustrated with several 2D examples that are widely used in the recent literature of topology optimization, especially in the homogenization based methods.},

  abstract = {Topology optimization is a methodology for assigning material or void to each point in a design domain in a way that extremizes some objective function, such as the compliance of a structure under given loads, subject to various imposed constraints, such as an upper bound on the mass of the structure. Geometry projection is a means to parameterize the topology optimization problem, by describing the design in a way that is independent of the mesh used for analysis of the design's performance; it results in many fewer design parameters, necessarily resolves the ill-posed nature of the topology optimization problem, and provides sharp descriptions of the material interfaces. We extend previous geometric projection work to 3 dimensions and design unit cells for lattice materials using inverse homogenization. We perform a sensitivity analysis of the geometric projection and show it has smooth derivatives, making it suitable for use with gradient-based optimization algorithms. The technique is demonstrated by designing unit cells comprised of a single constituent material plus void space to obtain light, stiff materials with cubic and isotropic material symmetry. We also design a single-constituent isotropic material with negative Poisson's ratio and a light, stiff material comprised of 2 constituent solids plus void space.},

In this paper, we present a method to generate bone-like porous structures as lightweight infill for additive manufacturing. Our method builds upon and extends voxel-wise topology optimization. In particular, for the purpose of generating sparse yet stable structures distributed in the interior of a given shape, we propose upper bounds on the localized material volume in the proximity of each voxel in the design domain. We then aggregate the local per-voxel constraints by their p-norm into an equivalent global constraint, in order to facilitate an efficient optimization process. Implemented on a high-resolution topology optimization framework, our results demonstrate mechanically optimized, detailed porous structures which mimic those found in nature. We further show variants of the optimized structures subject to different design specifications, and we analyze the optimality and robustness of the obtained structures.},
