The resulting problem is nonconvex, and for topology design very large, as one seeks the optimal topology as a subset of a large number of potential bars connecting all nodal points of an initially chosen set. In this paper we present a number of equivalent formulations in the displacements only, taking full advantage of the structure of the optimization problem. The equivalent formulations are of min-max type or are quadratic programming problems in the displacements, reducing in some cases even to linear programming problems.},

  abstract = {The paper addresses the classical problem of optimal truss design where cross-sectional areas and the positions of joints are simultaneously optimized. Se-veral approaches are discussed from a general point of view. In particular, we focus on the difference between simultaneous and alternating optimization of geometry and topology. We recall a rigorously mathematical approach based on the implicit programming technique which considers the classical single load minimum compliance problem subject to a volume constraint. This approach is refined leading to three new problem formulations which can be treated by methods of Mathematical Programming. In particular, these formulations cover the effect of melting end nodes, i.e., vanishing potential bars due to changes in the geometry. In one of these new problem formulations, the objective function is a polynomial of degree three and the constraints are bilinear or just sign constraints. Because heuristics is avoided, certain optimality properties can be proven for resulting structures. The paper closes with two numerical test examples.},

We implement this method in two and three space dimensions for a model of linear or nonlinear elasticity. We consider various objective functions with weight and perimeter constraints. The shape derivative is computed by an adjoint method. The cost of our numerical algorithm is moderate since the shape is captured on a ﬁxed Eulerian mesh. Although this method is not speciﬁcally designed for topology optimization, it can easily handle topology changes. However, the resulting optimal shape is strongly dependent on the initial guess.},

The direct dependence of the material properties on its pointwise density is replaced by a regularization of the density ÿeld by the mean of a convolution operator. In this setting it is possible to establish the existence of solutions. Moreover, convergence of an approximation by means of ÿnite elements can be obtained.

The main manufacturing issues discussed are the potential for realizing intermediate density regions, in the case of the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) approach, the use of small scale lattice structures, the use of multiple material AM processes, and an approach to including support structure requirement as a manufacturing constraint.},

The distinctive feature of this new approach is that unlike the typical treatment of topology optimization problems based on the ground structure approach, we eliminate the singular optima from the problem formulation and thus unify the sizing and topology optimization within the same framework. As a result, numerical methods developed for sizing optimization problems can be applied directly to the solution of topology optimization problems without any further treatment. The application of the proposed approach and its effectiveness are illustrated with several numerical examples.},

  abstract   = {Stress-constrained topology optimization requires techniques for handling thousands to millions of stress constraints. This work presents a comprehensive numerical study comparing local and global stress constraint strategies in topology optimization. Four local and four global solution strategies are presented and investigated. The local strategies are based on either the augmented Lagrangian or the pure exterior penalty method, whereas the global strategies are based on the P-mean aggregation function. Extensive parametric studies are carried out on the L-shaped design problem to identify the most promising parameters for each solution strategy. It is found that (1) the local strategies are less sensitive to the continuation procedure employed in standard density-based topology optimization, allowing achievement of better quality results using less iterations when compared with the global strategies; (2) the global strategies become competitive when P values larger than 100 are employed, but for this to be possible a very slow continuation procedure should be used; (3) the local strategies based on the augmented Lagrangian method provide the best compromise between computational cost and performance, being able to achieve optimized topologies at the level of a pure P-continuation global strategy with P=300, but using less iterations.},

In addition, a simple scheme is proposed to increase accuracy of stress evaluation at jagged edges, based on limiting sharpness of the projections to intentionally allow a thin layer of intermediate material between solid and void phases. A reference problem is analyzed through voxel-based finite element models, demonstrating that, in association with a proper choice of stiffness and stress interpolation functions, the proposed scheme can ensure consistent stress magnitude and smooth stress behavior for uniform boundary variation. Optimization problems are solved and post-processing with body-fitted meshes is performed over optimized solutions, demonstrating that: (1) stresses evaluated with voxel-based meshes containing thin soft transition boundaries are consistent with stresses evaluated with body-fitted meshes; and (2) optimized structures are robust with respect to uniform boundary variations.},

Starting from the lower-bound formulation in topology optimization, the problem is further expanded to geometry optimization and multiple loading scenarios, and systematically reformulated to alleviate numerical difficulties related to the melting node effect and stress singularities. The subsequent simultaneous analysis and design (SAND) formulation is well suited for a direct treatment by introducing a barrier function. Using exact second derivatives, this difficult class of problem is solved by sequential quadratic programming with trust regions. These building blocks result into an integrated design process. Two examples–including a large-scale application–illustrate the robustness of the proposed formulation.},

  abstract = {A methodology for imposing a minimum length scale on structural members in discretized topology optimization problems is described. Nodal variables are implemented as the design variables and are projected onto element space to determine the element volume fractions that traditionally define topology. The projection is made via mesh independent functions that are based upon the minimum length scale. A simple linear projection scheme and a non-linear scheme using a regularized Heaviside step function to achieve nearly 0–1 solutions are examined. The new approach is demonstrated on the minimum compliance problem and the popular SIMP method is used to penalize the stiffness of intermediate volume fraction elements. Solutions are shown to meet user-defined length scale criterion without additional constraints, penalty functions or sensitivity filters. No instances of mesh dependence or checkerboard patterns have been observed. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Numerical layout optimization provides a computationally efﬁcient and generally applicable means of identifying the optimal arrangement of bars in a truss. When the plastic layout optimization formulation is used, a wide variety of problem types can be solved using linear programming. However, the solutions obtained are frequently quite complex, particularly when ﬁne numerical discretizations are employed. To address this, the efﬁcacy of two rationalization techniques are explored in this paper: (i) introduction of ‘joint lengths’, and (ii) application of geometry optimization. In the former case this involves the use of a modiﬁed layout optimization formulation, which remains linear, whilst in the latter case a non-linear optimization post-processing step, involving adjusting the locations of nodes in the layout optimized solution, is undertaken. The two rationalization techniques are applied to example problems involving both point and distributed loads, self-weight and multiple load cases. It is demonstrated that the introduction of joint lengths reduces structural complexity at negligible computational cost, though generally leads to increased volumes. Conversely, the use of geometry optimization carries a computational cost but is effective in reducing both structural complexity and the computed volume.},

  abstract = {This paper develops and evaluates a method for handling stress constraints in topology optimization. The stress constraints are used together with an objective function that minimizes mass or maximizes stiffness, and in addition, the traditional stiffness based formulation is discussed for comparison. We use a clustering technique, where stresses for several stress evaluation points are clustered into groups using a modified P-norm to decrease the number of stress constraints and thus the computational cost. We give a detailed description of the formulations and the sensitivity analysis. This is done in a general manner, so that different element types and 2D as well as 3D structures can be treated. However, we restrict the numerical examples to 2D structures with bilinear quadrilateral elements. The three formulations and different approaches to stress constraints are compared using two well known test examples in topology optimization: the L-shaped beam and the MBB-beam. In contrast to some other papers on stress constrained topology optimization, we find that our formulation gives topologies that are significantly different from traditionally optimized designs, in that it actually manage to avoid stress concentrations. It can therefore be used to generate conceptual designs for industrial applications.},

  abstract = {Despite the long history of the truss layout optimization approach, its practical applications have been limited, partly due to high manufacturing costs associated with complex optimized structures consisting of members with different cross-sectional areas and member lengths. To address this issue, this study considers optimizing truss structures comprising limited types of members. On this topic, two distinct problems are considered, wherein the first problem, members of the same type share the same cross-sectional area (i.e., section-type problem); and in the second problem, members of the same type share the same cross-sectional area and length (i.e., member-type problem). A novel post-processing approach is proposed to tackle the target problems. In this approach, the optimized structures from the traditional layout and geometry optimization approaches are used as the starting points, members of which are then separated into groups by the k-means clustering approach. Subsequently, the clustered structures are geometrically optimized to reduce the area and length deviations (i.e., the differences between member area/length values and the corresponding cluster means). Several 2D and 3D examples are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approaches. For the section-type problem, the area deviations can be reduced to near 0 for any given cluster number. The member-type problem is relatively more complex, but by providing more clusters, the maximum length deviation can be reduced below the target thresholds. Through the proposed clustering approach, the number of different members in the optimized trusses can be substantially decreased, thereby significantly reducing manufacturing costs.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for shape optimization that uses an analytical description of the varying design geometry as the control in the optimization problem. A straightforward filtering technique projects the design geometry onto a fictitious analysis domain to support simplified response and sensitivity analysis. However, the analytical geometry model is referenced directly for all purely geometric calculations. The method thus combines the advantages of direct geometry representations with the simplified analysis procedures that are possible with fictitious domain analysis methods, such as the material distribution methods commonly used in topology optimization. The projected geometry measure converges to the indicator function of the analytical geometry model in the limit of numerical mesh refinement. Consequently, optimal designs obtained with the new method converge to solutions of well-defined continuum optimization problems in the limit of mesh refinement. This property is confirmed in example computations for minimum compliance design of an elastic structure subject to a volume constraint and for minimum volume design subject to a maximum stress constraint.

  abstract = {This article describes a method for the continuum-based topology optimization of structures made of discrete elements. In particular, we examine the optimization of linearly elastic planar structures made of bars of fixed width and semicircular ends. The design space for the optimization consists of the endpoint locations of the bar's medial axes and their out-of-plane thicknesses. To circumvent re-meshing upon design changes, we project the design onto a fixed analysis grid using a differentiable geometry projection that results in a density field indicating the fraction of solid material anywhere in the design space, as in density-based topology optimization methods. The out-of-plane thickness is penalized so that the optimizer is capable of removing bars during the optimization. The differentiability of the projection allows for the computation via the chain rule of design sensitivities of responses of interest, and therefore it allows for the use of robust and efficient gradient-based optimization methods. Notably, this approach makes it easier to fabricate optimal designs by using off-the-shelf stock material. Furthermore, the method considers the case where bars overlap at their joints (i.e. their thicknesses are added at the joint) and when they do not. Finally, our proposed method naturally accommodates the imposition of several fixed length scales. We demonstrate the proposed approach on classical problems of compliance-based topology optimization and identify its benefits as well as research directions to be addressed in the future.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the field of additive manufacturing (AM), often referred to as 3D printing, has seen tremendous growth and radically changed the means by which we describe valid 3D models for production. In particular, it is now conceivable to produce composite structures consisting of smoothly varying oriented anisotropic constitutive materials. In the present work, we propose a sensitivity driven method for the generation of transverse isotropic fiber reinforced structures having smooth spatially varying orientations. Our approach builds upon finite element analysis (FEA) and density-based topology optimization (TO). The local material orientations are formulated as design variables in a stiffness maximization problem, and solved with a non-convex gradient-based optimization scheme. Length-scale control is achieved through the use of filters for regularization. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to handle large-scale 3D problems with synchronous optimization of material densities and orientations yielding millions of design variables on multiple load case scenarios. The method is shown to be compatible with compliant mechanism optimization as well as local volume constraints. Finally, the approach is extended with an additional design variable dictating the ratio of anisotropy for each element, thereby delegating the choice of material type to the optimization scheme.},

Examples are MEMS devices manufactured using etching processes, nano-devices manufactured using e-beam lithography or laser micro-machining and macro structures manufactured using milling processes. In the suggested robust topology optimization approach, under- and over-etching is modelled by image processing-based “erode” and “dilate” operators and the optimization problem is formulated as a worst case design problem. Applications of the method to the design of macro structures for minimum compliance and micro compliant mechanisms show that the method provides manufacturing tolerant designs with little decrease in performance. As a positive side effect the robust design formulation also eliminates the longstanding problem of one-node connected hinges in compliant mechanism design using topology optimization.},

  abstract   = {This paper deals with the construction of materials with arbitrary prescribed positive semi-definite constitutive tensors. The construction problem can be called an inverse problem of finding a material with given homogenized coefficients. The inverse problem is formulated as a topology optimization problem i.e. finding the interior topology of a base cell such that cost is minimized and the constraints are defined by the prescribed constitutive parameters. Numerical values of the constitutive parameters of a given material are found using a numerical homogenization method expressed in terms of element mutual energies. Numerical results show that arbitrary materials, including materials with Poisson's ratio −1.0 and other extreme materials, can be obtained by modelling the base cell as a truss structure. Furthermore, a wide spectrum of materials can be constructed from base cells modelled as continuous discs of varying thickness. Only the two-dimensional case is considered in this paper but formulation and numerical procedures can easily be extended to the three-dimensional case.},

Both first- and second-order sensitivities are derived as well as first-order sensitivities for symmetric positive definite eigenvalue systems. Although these results are not new, some of the derivations offer a different perspective than those previously presented. This article is meant as a tutorial, and as such, a simple two-degree-of-freedom spring system is employed to exemplify the sensitivity analyses. However, the concepts presented in this trivial example may be readily extended to compute sensitivities for complex systems via numerical techniques such as the finite element, boundary element, and finite difference methods.},

These lattice structures possess exceptional mechanical strength resulting in highly efficient load supporting systems when configured as the cores of sandwich panels. These same structures also provide interesting possibilities for cross flow heat exchange. In this scenario, heat is transported from a locally heated facesheet through the lattice structure by conduction and is dissipated by a cross flow that propagates through the low flow resistant pore passages. The combination of efficient thermal conduction along the lattice trusses and low flow resistance through the pore channels results in highly efficient cross flow heat exchange. Recent research is investigating the use of hollow truss structures that enable their simultaneous use as heat pipes which significantly increases the efficiency of heat transport through the lattice and their mechanical strength. The relationships between heat transfer, frictional flow losses and topology of the lattice structure are discussed and opportunities for future developments identified.},

We represent the structural boundary by a level set model that is embedded in a scalar function of a higher dimension. Such level set models are flexible in handling complex topological changes and are concise in describing the boundary shape of the structure. Furthermore, a well-founded mathematical procedure leads to a numerical algorithm that describes a structural optimization as a sequence of motions of the implicit boundaries converging to an optimum solution and satisfying specified constraints. The result is a 3D topology optimization technique that demonstrates outstanding flexibility of handling topological changes, fidelity of boundary representation and degree of automation. We have implemented the algorithm with the use of several robust and efficient numerical techniques of level set methods. The benefit and the advantages of the proposed method are illustrated with several 2D examples that are widely used in the recent literature of topology optimization, especially in the homogenization based methods.},

  abstract = {Topology optimization is a methodology for assigning material or void to each point in a design domain in a way that extremizes some objective function, such as the compliance of a structure under given loads, subject to various imposed constraints, such as an upper bound on the mass of the structure. Geometry projection is a means to parameterize the topology optimization problem, by describing the design in a way that is independent of the mesh used for analysis of the design's performance; it results in many fewer design parameters, necessarily resolves the ill-posed nature of the topology optimization problem, and provides sharp descriptions of the material interfaces. We extend previous geometric projection work to 3 dimensions and design unit cells for lattice materials using inverse homogenization. We perform a sensitivity analysis of the geometric projection and show it has smooth derivatives, making it suitable for use with gradient-based optimization algorithms. The technique is demonstrated by designing unit cells comprised of a single constituent material plus void space to obtain light, stiff materials with cubic and isotropic material symmetry. We also design a single-constituent isotropic material with negative Poisson's ratio and a light, stiff material comprised of 2 constituent solids plus void space.},

In this paper, we present a method to generate bone-like porous structures as lightweight infill for additive manufacturing. Our method builds upon and extends voxel-wise topology optimization. In particular, for the purpose of generating sparse yet stable structures distributed in the interior of a given shape, we propose upper bounds on the localized material volume in the proximity of each voxel in the design domain. We then aggregate the local per-voxel constraints by their p-norm into an equivalent global constraint, in order to facilitate an efficient optimization process. Implemented on a high-resolution topology optimization framework, our results demonstrate mechanically optimized, detailed porous structures which mimic those found in nature. We further show variants of the optimized structures subject to different design specifications, and we analyze the optimality and robustness of the obtained structures.},

By analysing the basic features of such a two-scale problem, it is shown that the optimal solution strongly depends upon the scale effect modelling of the periodic microstructure of material unit cell (MUC), i.e. the so-called representative volume element (RVE). However, with the asymptotic homogenization method used widely in actual topology optimization procedure, effective material properties predicted can give rise to limit values depending upon only volume fractions of solid phases, properties and spatial distribution of constituents in the microstructure regardless of scale effect. From this consideration, we propose the design element (DE) concept being able to deal with conventional designs of materials and structures in a unified way. By changing the scale and aspect ratio of the DE, scale-related effects of materials and structures are well revealed and distinguished in the final results of optimal design patterns. To illustrate the proposed approach, numerical design problems of 2D layered structures with cellular core are investigated. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The numerical results obtained are shown to be in close agreement (up to twelve significant digits) with analytical results. Finally, the problem of generalized shape optimization (finding the best boundary topology and shape) is discussed.},
