The resulting problem is nonconvex, and for topology design very large, as one seeks the optimal topology as a subset of a large number of potential bars connecting all nodal points of an initially chosen set. In this paper we present a number of equivalent formulations in the displacements only, taking full advantage of the structure of the optimization problem. The equivalent formulations are of min-max type or are quadratic programming problems in the displacements, reducing in some cases even to linear programming problems.},

  abstract   = {The paper considers the problem of optimal truss topology design with respect to stress, slenderness, and local buckling constraints. An exact problem formulation is used dealing with the inherent difficulty that the local buckling constraints are discontinuous functions in the bar areas due to the topology aspect. This exact problem formulation has been derived in Part I. In this paper, a numerical approach to this nonconvex and largescale problem is proposed. First, discontinuity of constraints is erased by providing an equivalent formulation in standard form of nonlinear programming. Then a linearization concept is proposed partly preserving the given problem structure. It is proved that the resulting sequential linear programming algorithm is a descent method generating truss designs feasible for the original problem. A numerical test on a nontrivial example shows that the exact treatment of the problem leads to different designs than the usual local buckling constraints neglecting the difficulties induced by the topology aspect.},

  abstract = {The paper addresses the classical problem of optimal truss design where cross-sectional areas and the positions of joints are simultaneously optimized. Se-veral approaches are discussed from a general point of view. In particular, we focus on the difference between simultaneous and alternating optimization of geometry and topology. We recall a rigorously mathematical approach based on the implicit programming technique which considers the classical single load minimum compliance problem subject to a volume constraint. This approach is refined leading to three new problem formulations which can be treated by methods of Mathematical Programming. In particular, these formulations cover the effect of melting end nodes, i.e., vanishing potential bars due to changes in the geometry. In one of these new problem formulations, the objective function is a polynomial of degree three and the constraints are bilinear or just sign constraints. Because heuristics is avoided, certain optimality properties can be proven for resulting structures. The paper closes with two numerical test examples.},

  abstract = {The symmetric sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SymmSpMV) is an important building block for many numerical linear algebra kernel operations or graph traversal applications. Parallelizing SymmSpMV on today's multicore platforms with up to 100 cores is difficult due to the need to manage conflicting updates on the result vector. Coloring approaches can be used to solve this problem without data duplication, but existing coloring algorithms do not take load balancing and deep memory hierarchies into account, hampering scalability and full-chip performance. In this work, we propose the recursive algebraic coloring engine (RACE), a novel coloring algorithm and open-source library implementation that eliminates the shortcomings of previous coloring methods in terms of hardware efficiency and parallelization overhead. We describe the level construction, distance-k coloring, and load balancing steps in RACE, use it to parallelize SymmSpMV, and compare its performance on 31 sparse matrices with other state-of-the-art coloring techniques and Intel MKL on two modern multicore processors. RACE outperforms all other approaches substantially. By means of a parameterized roofline model, we analyze the SymmSpMV performance in detail and discuss outliers. While we focus on SymmSpMV in this article, our algorithm and software are applicable to any sparse matrix operation with data dependencies that can be resolved by distance-k coloring.},

It is here brieÔ¨Çy recalled. In the more realistic context of ‚Äúmultiple loads‚Äù, i.e. when the structure is optimized with respect to more than one set of external forces, most of the obtained theoretical results remain true.

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the topology optimization of structures made of periodically perforated material, where the microscopic periodic cell can be macroscopically modulated and oriented. The main idea is to optimize the homogenized formulation of this problem, which is an easy task of parametric optimization, then to project the optimal microstructure at a desired lengthscale, which is a delicate issue, albeit computationally cheap. The main novelty of our work is, in a plane setting, the conformal treatment of the optimal orientation of the microstructure. In other words, although the periodicity cell has varying parameters and orientation throughout the computational domain, the angles between its members or bars are conserved. The main application of our work is the optimization of so-called lattice materials which are becoming increasingly popular in the context of additive manufacturing. Several numerical examples are presented for compliance minimization in 2-d.},

  abstract = {Stiffened shells and plates are widely used in engineering. Their performance is highly influenced by the arrangement, or layout, of stiffeners on the base shell or plate and the geometric features, or topology, of these stiffeners. Moreover, modular design is beneficial, since it allows for increased quality control and mass production. In this work, a method is developed that simultaneously optimizes the topology of stiffeners and their layout on a base shell or plate. This is accomplished by introducing a fixed number of modular stiffeners, which are subject to density-based topology optimization and a mapping of these modules to a ground structure. To illustrate potential applications, several stiffened plates and shell examples are presented. All examples demonstrated that the proposed method is able to generate clear topologies for any number of modules and a distinct layout of the stiffeners on the base shell or plate.},

For the case of maximization of stiffness for a prescribed volume,this paper presents a new equivalent, an unconstrained and convex minimization problem in displacements only, where the function to be minimized is the sum of terms, each of which is the maximum of two convex,quadratic functions. Existence of solutions is proved, as is the convergence of a nonsmooth steepest descent-type algorithm for solving the topology optimization problem. The algorithm is computationally attractive and has been tested on a large number of examples, some of which are presented.},

Every point in space is thus a material point or a void and the optimization problem is a discrete variable one. This paper describes various ways of removing this discrete nature of the problem by the introduction of a density function that is a continuous design variable. Domains of high density then define the shape of the mechanical element. For intermediate densities, material parameters given by an artificial material law can be used. Alternatively, the density can arise naturally through the introduction of periodically distributed, microscopic voids, so that effective material parameters for intermediate density values can be computed through homogenization. Several examples in two-dimensional elasticity illustrate that these methods allow a determination of the topology of a mechanical element, as required for a boundary variations shape optimization technique.},

The design objective is to minimize a power function, which for the absence of body fluid forces is the dissipated power in the fluid, subject to a fluid volume constraint. A generalized Stokes problem is derived that is used as a base for introducing the design parameterization. Mathematical proofs of existence of optimal solutions and convergence of discretized solutions are given and it is concluded that no regularization of the optimization problem is needed. The discretized state problem is a mixed finite element problem that is solved by a preconditioned conjugate gradient method and the design optimization problem is solved using sequential separable and convex programming. Several numerical examples are presented that illustrate this new methodology and the results are compared to results obtained in the context of shape optimization of fluids.

The global constraint provides the expected stiffness to the optimal design while a selected set of local enforcements require feasibility with respect to the assigned strength of material. The Drucker‚ÄìPrager failure criterion is implemented to handle materials with either equal or unequal behavior in tension and compression. A suitable relaxation of the equivalent stress measure is implemented to overcome the difficulties related to the singularity problem. Numerical examples are presented to discuss the features of the achieved optimal designs along with performances of the adopted procedure. Comparisons with pure compliance‚Äìbased or pure stress‚Äìbased strategies are also provided to point out differences arising in the optimal design with respect to conventional approaches, depending on the assumed material behavior.},

While this assumption is valid for a wide variety of problems, it is not valid for structures undergoing large displacements. The elastic structural analysis used here accommodates geometric and material non-linearities. The material density field is filtered to enforce a length scale on the field variation and is penalized to remove less effective intermediate densities. The filtering scheme is embedded in the structural analysis to resolve the non-existent solution to the solid-void topology problem. In this way, we know precisely what optimization problem is being solved. The structural topology optimization formulation is also used to design compliant mechanisms.},

It is based on approximations of the MMA family (MMA and GCMMA), but it utilizes the gradients and/or the function values at two successive design points to improve the quality of the approximation. In addition, this scheme can consider simultaneously monotonous and nonmonotonous structural behaviour. According to the characteristics of the treated problem, one of the approximations or a mix of them is automatically selected. Based on this approach, the accuracy of the approximated subproblems is improved and the solution process can be sped up. Numerical results compare the effectiveness of the method with previously derived approximations of the MMA family for shape optimization of trusses and for composite design problems. The benefit of using mixed approximations is also discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes to investigate topology optimization with density-dependent body forces and especially self-weight loading. Surprisingly the solution of such problems cannot be based on a direct extension of the solution procedure used for minimum-compliance topology optimization with fixed external loads. At first the particular difficulties arising in the considered topology problems are pointed out: non-monotonous behaviour of the compliance, possible unconstrained character of the optimum and the parasitic effect for low densities when using the power model (SIMP). To get rid of the last problem requires the modification of the power law model for low densities. The other problems require that the solution procedure and the selection of appropriate structural approximations be revisited. Numerical applications compare the efficiency of different approximation schemes of the MMA family. It is shown that important improvements are achieved when the solution is carried out using the gradient-based method of moving asymptotes (GBMMA) approximations. Criteria for selecting the approximations are suggested. In addition, the applications also provide the opportunity to illustrate the strong influence of the ratio between the applied loads and the structural weight on the optimal structural topology.},

  abstract = {For the practical application of optimized truss structures, the local stability of the bar must be considered to obtain stable and realistic structures. However, in the practical design of structures, the initial crookedness of the bars and residual stresses that remain in the bar after the manufacturing process should be taken into account, which makes the buckling strength highly non-connected and non-convex in terms of the cross-sectional properties. Therefore, most conventional truss optimization formulations include only local buckling constraints based on the Euler buckling criterion, while local buckling constraints based on design specifications are rarely incorporated. To treat these problems, a novel topology optimization model for trusses is proposed, where the critical buckling strength is calculated according to the practical design code GB5007-2017. In addition, a linearized iterative allowable stress method is used to solve the optimization model. Since the allowable stresses are calculated at each iteration based on the critical buckling strength, other types of design codes can also be incorporated into the proposed truss topology optimization model. The proposed computational model shows, through several numerical examples, the remarkable effect of including local buckling stability in the optimal design of trusses, while demonstrating that the optimized topology depends on whether the local buckling constraints are derived from the Euler buckling criterion or from actual structural design codes.},

  abstract = {Strut-braced wing (SBW) is considered in the ongoing ONERA research project ALBATROS as one of a potential fuel-saving transport aircraft configuration. Although not a new concept [1] (several aircraft such as the Hurel-Dubois HD-34, 1956, have used this concept), it has recently received renewed interest since [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]. Indeed, the structural strut enables a reduction of the wing weight thanks to the reduction of the bending moment to be sustained by the wing box. The presence of the strut therefore enables to increase the wing aspect ratio, which results in direct aerodynamic performance gains, without considerable weight penalty as it is the case with conventional cantilever wings. The ALBATROS project aims at evaluating the potential of a strut-braced wing concept to improve the aero-structural efficiency of transonic transport aircraft. For that, specific studies are carried out to investigate the potential gains and possible problems of the concept in term of aerodynamics, structures and flight mechanics.},

  abstract = {The focus of this paper is on multi-material topology optimization (MMTO), where the objective is to not only compute the optimal topology, but also the distribution of two or more materials within the topology. In the popular density-based MMTO, the underlying pseudo-density fields are typically represented using an underlying mesh. While mesh-based MMTO ties in well with mesh-based finite element analysis, there are inherent challenges, namely the extraction of thin features, and the computation of the gradients of the density fields. The objective of this paper is to present a neural network (NN) based MMTO method where the density fields are represented in a mesh-independent manner, using the NN‚Äôs activation functions, with the weights and biases associated with the NN serving as the design variables. Then, by relying on the NN‚Äôs built-in optimization routines, and a conventional finite element solver, the MMTO problem is solved. The salient features of the proposed method include: (1) thin features can be extracted through a simple post-processing step, (2) gradients and sensitivities can be computed accurately through back-propagation, (3) the NN construction implicitly guarantees the partition of unity between constituent materials, (4) the NN designs often exhibit better performance than mesh-based designs, and (5) the number of design variables is relatively small. Finally, the proposed framework is simple to implement, and is illustrated through several examples.},

As a result, numerical methods developed for sizing optimization problems can be applied directly to the solution of topology optimization problems without any further treatment.

This problem is often solved by formulating it as an optimization problem. In this approach, the unit-cell is assumed infinitely small and with periodic boundary conditions. However, in practice, the composite material comprises a finite number of measurable unit-cells and the stress/strain fields are not periodic near the structure boundary.

The emergence of novel additive manufacturing techniques fosters research towards new approaches to tailor materials properties. This paper derives a formulation to prevent the occurrence of high stress concentrations, often present in optimized microstructures. Applying macroscopic test strain fields to the material, microstructural layouts, reducing the stress level while exhibiting the best overall stiffness properties, are sought for. Equivalent stiffness properties of the designed material are predicted by numerical homogenization and considering a metallic base material for the microstructure, it is assumed that the classical Von Mises stress criterion remains valid to predict the material elastic allowable stress at the microscale. Stress constraints with arbitrary bounds are considered, assuming that a sizing optimization step could be applied to match the actual stress limits under realistic service loads. Density‚Äìbased topology optimization, relying on the SIMP model, is used and the qp‚Äìapproach is exploited to overcome the singularity phenomenon arising from the introduction of stress constraints with vanishing material. Optimization problems are solved using mathematical programming schemes, in particular MMA, so that a sensitivity analysis of stress responses at the microstructural level is required and performed considering the adjoint approach. Finally, the developed method is first validated with classical academic benchmarks and then illustrated with an original application: tailoring metamaterials for a museum anti‚Äìseismic stand.},

  abstract  = {Polytopes are geometrical figures bounded by portions of lines, planes, or hyperplanes. In plane (two dimensional) geometry, they are known as polygons and comprise such figures as triangles, squares, pentagons, etc. In solid (three dimensional) geometry they are known as polyhedra and include such figures as tetrahedra (a type of pyramid), cubes, icosahedra, and many more; the possibilities, in fact, are infinite! H. S. M. Coxeter's book is the foremost book available on regular polyhedra, incorporating not only the ancient Greek work on the subject, but also the vast amount of information that has been accumulated on them since, especially in the last hundred years. The author, professor of Mathematics, University of Toronto, has contributed much valuable work himself on polytopes and is a well-known authority on them. Professor Coxeter begins with the fundamental concepts of plane and solid geometry and then moves on to multi-dimensionality. Among the many subjects covered are Euler's formula, rotation groups, star-polyhedra, truncation, forms, vectors, coordinates, kaleidoscopes, Petrie polygons, sections and projections, and star-polytopes. Each chapter ends with a historical summary showing when and how the information contained therein was discovered. Numerous figures and examples and the author's lucid explanations also help to make the text readily comprehensible. Although the study of polytopes does have some practical applications to mineralogy, architecture, linear programming, and other areas, most people enjoy contemplating these figures simply because their symmetrical shapes have an aesthetic appeal. But whatever the reasons, anyone with an elementary knowledge of geometry and trigonometry will find this one of the best source books available on this fascinating study.},

The use of a modular, lattice-based, ultralight material results in stiffness typical of an elastomer (2.6 MPa) at a mass density typical of an aerogel . This, combined with a building block based manufacturing and configuration strategy, enables the rapid realization of new adaptive structures and mechanisms. The heterogeneous design with programmable anisotropy allows for enhanced elastic and global shape deformation in response to external loading, making it useful for tuned fluid-structure interaction. We demonstrate an example application experiment using two building block types for the primary structure of a 4.27 m wingspan aircraft, where we spatially program elastic shape morphing to increase aerodynamic efficiency and improve roll control authority, demonstrated with full-scale wind tunnel testing.},

  abstract   = {Stress-constrained topology optimization requires techniques for handling thousands to millions of stress constraints. This work presents a comprehensive numerical study comparing local and global stress constraint strategies in topology optimization. Four local and four global solution strategies are presented and investigated. The local strategies are based on either the augmented Lagrangian or the pure exterior penalty method, whereas the global strategies are based on the P-mean aggregation function. Extensive parametric studies are carried out on the L-shaped design problem to identify the most promising parameters for each solution strategy. It is found that (1) the local strategies are less sensitive to the continuation procedure employed in standard density-based topology optimization, allowing achievement of better quality results using less iterations when compared with the global strategies; (2) the global strategies become competitive when P values larger than 100 are employed, but for this to be possible a very slow continuation procedure should be used; (3) the local strategies based on the augmented Lagrangian method provide the best compromise between computational cost and performance, being able to achieve optimized topologies at the level of a pure P-continuation global strategy with P=300, but using less iterations.},

In addition, a simple scheme is proposed to increase accuracy of stress evaluation at jagged edges, based on limiting sharpness of the projections to intentionally allow a thin layer of intermediate material between solid and void phases. A reference problem is analyzed through voxel-based finite element models, demonstrating that, in association with a proper choice of stiffness and stress interpolation functions, the proposed scheme can ensure consistent stress magnitude and smooth stress behavior for uniform boundary variation. Optimization problems are solved and post-processing with body-fitted meshes is performed over optimized solutions, demonstrating that: (1) stresses evaluated with voxel-based meshes containing thin soft transition boundaries are consistent with stresses evaluated with body-fitted meshes; and (2) optimized structures are robust with respect to uniform boundary variations.},

Within the scope of static analyses and stiffness design of such type of lightweight and functional structures, size effects of the basic cell are studied both theoretically and numerically in a systematic way for the first time. The direct FE discretization method, the homogenization method and the classical beam theory are examined systematically to reveal, on one hand, the existence of the size effect, and on the other hand, the ability of each method in capturing the size effect upon the static stress distribution and structural deflection. Particularly, limitations of the homogenization method are clarified although the latter is widely applied today in the equivalent modeling and topology design of cellular materials of sandwich structures. By means of the above methods, bending problems of multilayered beams and cellular core sandwiches are solved to illustrate variations of the deflection, stress as well as the computing accuracies in terms of the size of the basic cell. It is shown that the size effect is important when the basic cell has a considerable dimension relative to the structural size and that this effect decreases rapidly with the size reduction of the basic cell. Theoretically, the homogenized result corresponds to the limit solution when the size of the basic cell tends to be infinitely small.},

The subsequent simultaneous analysis and design (SAND) formulation is well suited for a direct treatment by introducing a barrier function. Using exact second derivatives, this difficult class of problem is solved by sequential quadratic programming with trust regions. These building blocks result into an integrated design process.

  abstract = {This paper presents a computationally efficient method for truss layout optimization with stability constraints. Previously proposed approaches that ensure stability of optimal frameworks are first reviewed, showing that existing studies are generally restricted to topology optimization. The present contribution aims to generalize the approach to simultaneous geometry and topology optimization. A lower-bound plastic design formulation under multiple loading will serve as basis for this purpose. The numerical difficulties associated with geometrical variations are identified and the parametrization is adapted accordingly. To avoid nodal instability, the nominal force method is adopted, which introduces artificial loading cases to simulate the effect of geometric imperfections. Hence, the truss systems with unstable nodes are eliminated from the set of optimal solutions. At the same time, the local stability of structural members is ensured via a consistent local buckling criterion. This novel formulation leads to optimal configurations that can be practically used for the preliminary design of structural frameworks. Four applications illustrate the impact of stability constraints on the solution. The importance of geometry optimization is also pointed out by comparing with results that would be unattainable by topology optimization only.},

ECOS is written in low footprint, single-threaded, library-free ANSI-C and so runs on most embedded platforms. The main interior-point algorithm is a standard primal-dual Mehrotra predictor-corrector method with Nesterov-Todd scaling and self-dual embedding, with search directions found via a symmetric indeÔ¨Ånite KKT system, chosen to allow stable factorization with a Ô¨Åxed pivoting order. The indeÔ¨Ånite system is solved using Davis‚Äô SparseLDL package, which we modify by adding dynamic regularization and iterative reÔ¨Ånement for stability and reliability, as is done in the CVXGEN code generation system, allowing us to avoid all numerical pivoting; the elimination ordering is found entirely symbolically. This keeps the solver simple, only 750 lines of code, with virtually no variation in run time. For small problems, ECOS is faster than most existing SOCP solvers; it is still competitive for mediumsized problems up to tens of thousands of variables.},

To fully leverage the potential benefits of additive manufacturing, we use topology optimization and compile a comprehensive database of printed materials and printing processes, which we share with the wider community. To account for the complex interdependence between materials and processes, our method employs a pairing system, which we efficiently reduce using topology optimization properties and a generalized form of Ashby indices. To enhance computational efficiency, we employ a meta-model. We validate our proposed method through successful testing on an aeronautical case and a pedestrian bridge, demonstrating its robustness even in the presence of environmental data uncertainty. The optimal material-process pair for the aeronautical structure is the cobalt-based super-alloy with the LENS process. Despite this pair having the highest material and processing emissions, the resulting lighter part lowers the use phase emissions. It appears that precise mechanical data is needed for the method to give accurate results: a 20\% drop of Young's modulus totally disrupts the material-process pair ranking.},

These properties provide an interesting point of view on the efficiency of topology optimization compared to other design approaches such as parametric structural optimization. We construct a simple meta-model which requires only one full topology optimization to fit the whole Pareto fronts. Precise Pareto fronts are obtained independently. The fast meta-model constructed has a maximum error of 6.4\% with respect to these precise Pareto fronts, on the different problems tested.

  abstract = {Multi-scale topology optimization (a.k.a. micro-structural topology optimization, MTO) consists in optimizing macro-scale and micro-scale topology simultaneously. MTO could improve structural performance of products significantly. However, a few issues related to connectivity between micro-structures and high computational cost have to be addressed, without resulting in loss of performance. In this paper, a new efficient multi-scale topology optimization (EMTO) framework has been developed for this purpose. Connectivity is addressed through adaptive transmission zones which limit loss of performance. A pre-computed database of micro-structures is used to speed up the computing. Design variables have also been chosen carefully and include the orientation of the micro-structures to enhance performance. EMTO has been successfully tested on two-dimensional compliance optimization problems. The results show significant improvements compared to mono-scale methods (compliance value lower by up to 20\% on a simplistic case or 4\% on a more realistic case), and also demonstrate the versatility of EMTO.},

We first consider relevant stress criteria for porous composite materials, initially by studying the stress states of the so-called rank 2 layered materials. Then, on the basis of the theoretical study of the rank 2 microstructures, we propose an empirical model that extends the power penalized stiffness model (also called SIMP for Solid Isotropic Microstructure with Penalization for inter-mediate densities). In a second part, solution aspects of topology problems are considered. To deal with the so-called ‚Äòsingularity‚Äô phenomenon of stress constraints in topology design, an œµ-constraint relaxation of the stress constraints is used. We describe the mathematical programming approach that is used to solve the numerical optimization problems, and show results for a number of example applications. ¬© 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This study highlights two important characteristics of the feasible set of MTSO problems considered here, in which force balance equations, Hooke‚Äôs law, yield stress, bound constraints on displacements, and local bucking are taken into account. Namely, we use the linear or bilinear nature of the problem to take advantage of re-scaling properties of both the problem‚Äôs design and auxiliary variables, as well as to extend the superposition principle to the case in which nonlinear stress constraints are considered. Taking advantage of these characteristics, we extend the neighborhood search mixed-integer linear optimization (NS-MILO) method (Shahabsafa et al. in SMO 63: 21‚Äì38, 2018), which provides an effective heuristic solution approach based on exact solution methods for MILO problems. Through extensive computational experiments, we demonstrate that the extended NS-MILO method provides highquality solutions for large-scale discrete MTSO problems in a reasonable time.},

Then, the problem is sequentially approximated by using MMA-like expansions and an OC-like scheme is tailored to update the variables. The inspection of the stress stiffness matrix leads to a vectorized implementation for its efficient construction and for the sensitivity analysis of the BLFs. This, coupled with the efficiency improvements already presented by Ferrari and Sigmund (Struct Multidiscip Optim 62:2211‚Äì2228, 2020a), cuts all the computational bottlenecks associated with setting up the buckling analysis and allows buckling topology optimization problems of an interesting size to be solved on a laptop.

  abstract = {This paper is motivated by the optimization of so-called lattice materials which are becoming increasingly popular in the context of additive manufacturing. Generalizing our previous work in 2-d we propose a method for topology optimization of structures made of periodically perforated material, where the microscopic periodic cell can be macroscopically modulated and oriented. This method is made of three steps. The first step amounts to compute the homogenized properties of an adequately chosen parametrized microstructure (here, a cubic lattice with varying bar thicknesses). The second step optimizes the homogenized formulation of the problem, which is a classical problem of parametric optimization. The third, and most delicate, step projects the optimal oriented microstructure at a desired length scale. Compared to the 2-d case where rotations are parametrized by a single angle, to which a conformality constraint can be applied, the 3-d case is more involved and requires new ingredients. In particular, the full rotation matrix is regularized (instead of just one angle in 2-d) and the projection map which deforms the square periodic lattice is computed component by component. Several numerical examples are presented for compliance minimization in 3-d.},

  abstract = {A methodology for imposing a minimum length scale on structural members in discretized topology optimization problems is described. Nodal variables are implemented as the design variables and are projected onto element space to determine the element volume fractions that traditionally define topology. The projection is made via mesh independent functions that are based upon the minimum length scale. A simple linear projection scheme and a non-linear scheme using a regularized Heaviside step function to achieve nearly 0‚Äì1 solutions are examined. The new approach is demonstrated on the minimum compliance problem and the popular SIMP method is used to penalize the stiffness of intermediate volume fraction elements. Solutions are shown to meet user-defined length scale criterion without additional constraints, penalty functions or sensitivity filters. No instances of mesh dependence or checkerboard patterns have been observed. Copyright ¬© 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

When the plastic layout optimization formulation is used, a wide variety of problem types can be solved using linear programming. However, the solutions obtained are frequently quite complex, particularly when Ô¨Åne numerical discretizations are employed. To address this, the efÔ¨Åcacy of two rationalization techniques are explored in this paper: (i) introduction of ‚Äòjoint lengths‚Äô, and (ii) application of geometry optimization. In the former case this involves the use of a modiÔ¨Åed layout optimization formulation, which remains linear, whilst in the latter case a non-linear optimization post-processing step, involving adjusting the locations of nodes in the layout optimized solution, is undertaken. The two rationalization techniques are applied to example problems involving both point and distributed loads, self-weight and multiple load cases. It is demonstrated that the introduction of joint lengths reduces structural complexity at negligible computational cost, though generally leads to increased volumes. Conversely, the use of geometry optimization carries a computational cost but is effective in reducing both structural complexity and the computed volume.},

  abstract = {This paper develops and evaluates a method for handling stress constraints in topology optimization. The stress constraints are used together with an objective function that minimizes mass or maximizes stiffness, and in addition, the traditional stiffness based formulation is discussed for comparison. We use a clustering technique, where stresses for several stress evaluation points are clustered into groups using a modified P-norm to decrease the number of stress constraints and thus the computational cost. We give a detailed description of the formulations and the sensitivity analysis. This is done in a general manner, so that different element types and 2D as well as 3D structures can be treated. However, we restrict the numerical examples to 2D structures with bilinear quadrilateral elements. The three formulations and different approaches to stress constraints are compared using two well known test examples in topology optimization: the L-shaped beam and the MBB-beam. In contrast to some other papers on stress constrained topology optimization, we find that our formulation gives topologies that are significantly different from traditionally optimized designs, in that it actually manage to avoid stress concentrations. It can therefore be used to generate conceptual designs for industrial applications.},

To satisfy the periodic constraint, the designable domain is divided into a certain number of identical unit cells. The optimal topology of the unit cell is determined by gradually removing and adding material based on a sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity numbers that consider the periodic constraint for the repetitive elements are developed. To demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of the proposed approach, topology design problems of 2D and 3D periodic structures are investigated. The results indicate that the optimal topology depends, to a great extent, on the defined unit cells and on the relative strength of other non-designable part, such as the skins of sandwich structures.},

The work exploits the high process flexibility and precision of additive manufacturing to the physical realization of complex microstructure of metamaterials by developing and implementing a multiscale approach. Structures derived from such metamaterials exhibit properties which differ from that of the constituent base material. A periodic microscale model is developed whose geometric parameterization enables smoothly changing properties and for which the connectivity of neighboring microstructures in the large-scale domain is guaranteed by slowly changing large-scale descriptions of the lattice parameters. A lattice-based functional grading of material is derived using the finite element method with sensitivities derived by the adjoint method. The novelty of the work lies in the use of multiple geometry-based small-scale design parameters for optimization problems in three-dimensional real space. The approach is demonstrated by solving a classical compliance minimization problem. The results show improved optimality compared to commonly implemented structural optimization algorithms.},

  abstract = {This work presents a computational method for the design of architected truss lattice materials where each strut can be made of one of a set of available materials. We design the lattices to extremize effective properties. As customary in topology optimization, we design a periodic unit cell of the lattice and obtain the effective properties via numerical homogenization. Each bar is represented as a cylindrical offset surface of a medial axis parameterized by the positions of the endpoints of the medial axis. These parameters are smoothly mapped onto a continuous density field for the primal and sensitivity analysis via the geometry projection method. A size variable per material is ascribed to each bar and penalized as in density-based topology optimization to facilitate the entire removal of bars from the design. During the optimization, we allow bars to be made of a mixture of the available materials. However, to ensure each bar is either exclusively made of one material or removed altogether from the optimal design, we impose optimization constraints that ensure each size variable is 0 or 1, and that at most one material size variable is 1. The proposed material interpolation scheme readily accommodates any number of materials. To obtain lattices with desired material symmetries, we design only a reference region of the unit cell and reflect its geometry projection with respect to the appropriate planes of symmetry. Also, to ensure bars remain whole upon reflection inside the unit cell or with respect to the periodic boundaries, we impose a no-cut constraint on the bars. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method via numerical examples of bulk and shear moduli maximization and Poisson‚Äôs ratio minimization for two- and three-material lattices with cubic symmetry.},

It is an alternative to the asymptotic homogenization design method (AHDM) to obtain continuous effective material property functions. While the AHDM uses the asymptotic homogenization theory (AHT) and Legendre polynomials, the RVE method calculates anisotropic effective material properties having nonlinear behavior with respect to design variables of microstructures, and it is easier to implement than AHT given the governing equations and appropriate boundary conditions. More efficient and accurate than Legendre polynomials, ML is used to build a continuous model of the RVE results required for simultaneous design of the overall topology configuration and local fiber material layout. To show the convenience and expandability of the proposed method, a 3D RVE model is also proposed through the extension of the 2D model.

  abstract  = {Assuming force method analysis formulation, the effect of compatibility conditions on optimal design of trusses is studied. Neglecting the latter conditions, a linear programming (LP) formulation is obtained. The possibility of applying prestressing forces by ‚Äúlack of fit‚Äù to maintain compatibility at the LP optimum is demonstrated. It has been shown that for structures subjected to a single loading condition, the LP lower‚Äêbound solution is the final optimum. Prestressing might be required to maintain compatibility in cases where the optimal solution represents a statically indeterminate structure. The various possible solutions for structures subjected to multiple loading conditions are discussed. It is shown that under certain circumstances, compatibility conditions can be satisfied at the LP optimum only by applying different sets of prestressing forces for the various loadings. For certain geometries, the LP solution represents multiple optimal topologies, part of them being statically determinate structures. In such cases, the LP lower‚Äêbound solution is the final optimum, and no prestressing is required to maintain compatibility. In cases where compatibility conditions considerably affect the solution, prestressing by lack of fit might significantly improve the final optimum.},

  abstract = {Optimal design of elastic trusses is formulated as an approximate linear programming problem. Using the force method of analysis, the redundant forces are expressed in linearized terms of the design variables. The solution of the resulting linear programming problem can be viewed as an exact optimum for a truss with different displacements corresponding to the unknown redundants. The latter displacements, computed directly from the linear programming solution, indicate the degree of not satisfying the compatibility conditions. This information can be used to introduce imaginary displacements in subsequent iteration cycles. An iterative procedure of solution is proposed in which both the design and the imaginary displacements are modified until the compatible optimal solution is reached. Each iteration cycle requires the solution of a linear programming problem. The proposed procedure provides more flexibility in the solution process than the usual algorithms based on a sequence of linear programs and may improve the convergence. Numerical examples illustrate the application of this procedure in optimal design of simple trusses.},

  abstract = {The topology of truss structures is optimized by assuming zero lower bounds on cross-sections. It is shown that the optimal topology might correspond to a singular solution even for simple structures. Assuming the force method analysis formulation, the problem can be stated in a linear programming (LP) form under certain assumptions. It is then possible to derive analytically some conditions related to optimal topologies. In addition, the difficulty of singular optimal solutions is eliminated. The effect of compatibility conditions on optimal topologies is studied. It is shown that for particular geometries or loading conditions, where some element forces change from tension to compression or vice versa, the optimal topology might represent an unstable structure. Analytical conditions are derived to obtain geometries of multiple optimal topologies. Part of the latter solutions usually represent statically determinate structures. It is shown that a transition in the set of active constraints at the optimum occurs at these particular geometries. The phenomena presented in this study might lead to a better understanding of some properties associated with optimum structural topologies, and to improved design procedures.},

MTO holds the promise of enhancing product-performance beyond what is possible today. Furthermore, with the advent of additive manufacturing, the resulting multiscale structures can be fabricated with relative ease. There are however two significant challenges associated with MTO: (1) high computational cost, and (2) potential loss of microstructural connectivity. In this paper, a novel density-and-strain-based K-means clustering method is proposed to reduce the computational cost of MTO. Further, a rotational degree of freedom is introduced to fully utilize the anisotropic nature of microstructures. Finally, the connectivity issue is addressed through auxiliary finite element fields. The proposed concepts are illustrated through several numerical examples applied to two-dimensional single-load problems.},

The goal of optimization is to achieve gradient density, adaptive orientation and variable scale (or periodic) lattice structures with the highest mechanical stiffness. The asymptotic homogenization method is employed for the calculation of the mechanical properties of various lattice structures. And an equation of elastic tensor and relative density of the unit cell is established. The established function above is then considered in the numerical optimization schemes. In the post-processing, we propose a numerical projecting method based on Fourier transform, which can synthesize conformal gradient lattice structure without changing the size and shape of the unit cells. Besides, the algorithm allows us to minimize distortion and prevent defects in the final lattice and keep the lattice structures smooth and continuous. Finally, in comparison with different parameters and methods are performed to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. The results show that the optimized anisotropic conformal gradient lattice structures are much stiffer and exhibit better structural robustness and buckling resistance than the uniform and the directly mapped designs.},

Both design and manufacturing engineers have benefited from these efforts because of the close-to-optimal and friendly-to-manufacture design solutions. Recently, additive manufacturing (AM) has received significant attention from both academia and industry. AM is characterized by producing geometrically complex components layer-by-layer, and greatly reduces the geometric complexity restrictions imposed on topology optimization by conventional manufacturing. In other words, AM can make near-full use of the freeform structural evolution of topology optimization. Even so, new rules and restrictions emerge due to the diverse and intricate AM processes, which should be carefully addressed when developing the AM-specific topology optimization algorithms. Therefore, the motivation of this perspective paper is to summarize the state-of-art topology optimization methods for a variety of AM topics. At the same time, this paper also expresses the authors‚Äô perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in these topics.

To mitigate this trade-off, this study presents a novel approach for designing truss structures that incorporates multiple types of modules. Additionally, both the module arrangement and module structures are determined by the optimization approach. To achieve this, a novel mixed-integer linear programming problem is developed, and a heuristic method is proposed to enhance computational efficiency.

  abstract = {Despite the long history of the truss layout optimization approach, its practical applications have been limited, partly due to high manufacturing costs associated with complex optimized structures consisting of members with different cross-sectional areas and member lengths. To address this issue, this study considers optimizing truss structures comprising limited types of members. On this topic, two distinct problems are considered, wherein the first problem, members of the same type share the same cross-sectional area (i.e., section-type problem); and in the second problem, members of the same type share the same cross-sectional area and length (i.e., member-type problem). A novel post-processing approach is proposed to tackle the target problems. In this approach, the optimized structures from the traditional layout and geometry optimization approaches are used as the starting points, members of which are then separated into groups by the k-means clustering approach. Subsequently, the clustered structures are geometrically optimized to reduce the area and length deviations (i.e., the differences between member area/length values and the corresponding cluster means). Several 2D and 3D examples are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approaches. For the section-type problem, the area deviations can be reduced to near 0 for any given cluster number. The member-type problem is relatively more complex, but by providing more clusters, the maximum length deviation can be reduced below the target thresholds. Through the proposed clustering approach, the number of different members in the optimized trusses can be substantially decreased, thereby significantly reducing manufacturing costs.},

This paper discusses the problem of finding the optimum thickness distribution of isotropic plate structures, with a given volume and layout, that would maximise the buckling load. A simple numerical method using the finite-element analysis is presented to obtain the optimum thickness distribution. Optimum designs of compression-loaded rectangular plates with different boundary conditions and plate aspect ratios are obtained by using the proposed method. Optimum designs from earlier studies and the methods of buckling analysis used to attain these results are discussed and compared with the designs from the proposed method. This paper also examines the reliability of the optimality criterion generally used for plate buckling optimization, which is based on the uniform strain energy density.},

  abstract = {In this paper, several issues related to member buckling in truss topology optimization are treated. In the conventional formulations, where cross-sectional areas of ground structure members are the design variables, member buckling constraints are known to be very difficult to handle, both numerically and theoretically. Buckling constraints produce a feasible set that is non-connected and non-convex. Furthermore, the so-called jump in the buckling length phenomenon introduces severe difficulties for determining the correct buckling strength of parallel consecutive compression members. These issues are handled in the paper by employing a mixed variable formulation of truss topology optimization problems. In this formulation, member buckling constraints become linear. Parallel consecutive members of the ground structure are identified as chains, and overlapping members are added to the ground structure between each pair of nodes of a chain. Buckling constraints are written for every member, and linear constraints on the binary member existence variables disallow impractical topologies. In the proposed approach, Euler buckling as well as buckling according to various design codes, can be incorporated. Numerical examples demonstrate that the optimum topology depends on whether the buckling constraints are derived from Euler‚Äôs theory or from design codes.},

  abstract = {We present a new method for shape optimization that uses an analytical description of the varying design geometry as the control in the optimization problem. A straightforward filtering technique projects the design geometry onto a fictitious analysis domain to support simplified response and sensitivity analysis. However, the analytical geometry model is referenced directly for all purely geometric calculations. The method thus combines the advantages of direct geometry representations with the simplified analysis procedures that are possible with fictitious domain analysis methods, such as the material distribution methods commonly used in topology optimization. The projected geometry measure converges to the indicator function of the analytical geometry model in the limit of numerical mesh refinement. Consequently, optimal designs obtained with the new method converge to solutions of well-defined continuum optimization problems in the limit of mesh refinement. This property is confirmed in example computations for minimum compliance design of an elastic structure subject to a volume constraint and for minimum volume design subject to a maximum stress constraint.

  abstract = {This article describes a method for the continuum-based topology optimization of structures made of discrete elements. In particular, we examine the optimization of linearly elastic planar structures made of bars of fixed width and semicircular ends. The design space for the optimization consists of the endpoint locations of the bar's medial axes and their out-of-plane thicknesses. To circumvent re-meshing upon design changes, we project the design onto a fixed analysis grid using a differentiable geometry projection that results in a density field indicating the fraction of solid material anywhere in the design space, as in density-based topology optimization methods. The out-of-plane thickness is penalized so that the optimizer is capable of removing bars during the optimization. The differentiability of the projection allows for the computation via the chain rule of design sensitivities of responses of interest, and therefore it allows for the use of robust and efficient gradient-based optimization methods. Notably, this approach makes it easier to fabricate optimal designs by using off-the-shelf stock material. Furthermore, the method considers the case where bars overlap at their joints (i.e. their thicknesses are added at the joint) and when they do not. Finally, our proposed method naturally accommodates the imposition of several fixed length scales. We demonstrate the proposed approach on classical problems of compliance-based topology optimization and identify its benefits as well as research directions to be addressed in the future.},

A corrector-type theorem (i.e., which permits, in some cases, replacing a sequence by its ‚Äútwo-scale‚Äù limit, up to a strongly convergent remainder in \$L{\textasciicircum}2 ({\textbackslash}Omega )\$) is also established. These results are especially useful for the homogenization of partial differential equations with periodically oscillating coefficients. In particular, a new method for proving the convergence of homogenization processes is proposed, which is an alternative to the so-called energy method of Tartar. The power and simplicity of the two-scale convergence method is demonstrated on several examples, including the homogenization of both linear and nonlinear second-order elliptic equations.},

  abstract = {Structural topology optimization problems have been traditionally stated and solved by means of maximum stiffness formulations. On the other hand, some effort has been devoted to stating and solving this kind of problems by means of minimum weight formulations with stress (and/or displacement) constraints. It seems clear that the latter approach is closer to the engineering point of view, but it also leads to more complicated optimization problems, since a large number of highly non-linear (local) constraints must be taken into account to limit the maximum stress (and/or displacement) at the element level. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of defining a so-called global constraint, which basic aim is to limit the maximum stress (and/or displacement) simultaneously within all the structure by means of one single inequality. Should this global constraint perform adequately, the complexity of the underlying mathematical programming problem would be drastically reduced. However, a certain weakening of the feasibility conditions is expected to occur when a large number of local constraints are lumped into one single inequality. With the aim of mitigating this undesirable collateral effect, we group the elements into blocks. Then, the local constraints corresponding to all the elements within each block can be combined to produce a single aggregated constraint per block. Finally, we compare the performance of these three approaches (local, global and block aggregated constraints) by solving several topology optimization problems.},

However, to commercialize lattice structures, it is necessary to define the designability of lattice geometries and characterize the associated mechanical responses, including the compressive strength. The objective of this study was to provide an optimized design process for lattice structures and develop a lattice structure characterization database that can be used to differentiate unit cell topologies and guide the unit cell selection for compression-dominated structures. Linear static finite element analysis (FEA), nonlinear FEA, and experimental tests were performed on 11 types of unit cell-based lattice structures with dimensions of 20 mm √ó 20 mm √ó 20 mm. Consequently, under the same relative density conditions, simple cubic, octahedron, truncated cube, and truncated octahedron-based lattice structures with a 3 √ó 3 √ó 3 array pattern showed the best axial compressive strength properties. Correlations among the unit cell types, lattice structure topologies, relative densities, unit cell array patterns, and mechanical properties were identified, indicating their influence in describing and predicting the behaviors of lattice structures.},

  abstract = {1. Abstract In the past few decades plastic layout optimization methods have been largely ignored in favour of those based upon elastic design principles. However, when multiple load cases are present elastic methods are generally computationally expensive and/or are prone to finding local optima. Therefore, they may not at present provide a suitable basis for practical truss layout optimization software, capable of treating real-world scale problems. In fact long computation times have impeded the development of truss layout optimization tools, both plastic and elastic. This is because, when using a fully connected ground structure, problem size quickly increases with increasing numbers of nodes in the design domain. Hence available memory can quickly become exhausted, preventing optimization even when using comparatively simple plastic problem formulations. Recently the authors presented a technique that allows large-scale plastic layout optimization to be performed on a typical desktop PC. Through the use of an iterative 'member-adding' algorithm, CPU times and memory requirements may be dramatically reduced, allowing problems containing up to approx. 1,000,000,000 potential members to be tackled. This paper extends the method so as to be capable of treating 3D problems with multiple load cases. Furthermore, in order to provide more realistic optimum structures, member self-weight and joint length penalties can also be included. Example problems demonstrate that the new algorithm is capable of optimizing structures with many millions of potential members, whilst still providing provably optimum},

  abstract = {Various computer methods have been developed for the optimal design of indeterminate structures, but it is not possible to guarantee that the result of any method will be a global optimum, rather than merely a local optimum. By temporarily neglecting the conditions of elastic compatibility and formulating a mathematical optimization problem based on the equilibrium conditions and the stress constraints, it is possible to obtain an approximate design which avoids merely local optima. In the cases examined, this design is close to the exact global optimum obtained by enforcing the compatibility conditions and is therefore a good starting point for an optimizing procedure. Examples include a graphical solution of a simple grillage known to have multiple local optima, and a sequence of planar trusses under alternate loading conditions. Linear programming is used to find the minimum weight truss designs satisfying equilibrium; this method eliminates extraneous members and leads to better indeterminate truss configurations than does a stress-ratio type algorithm.},

Different optimization solvers including Optimality Criteria (OC), the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA) and its globally convergent version GCMMA, the interior point solvers in IPOPT and FMINCON, and the sequential quadratic programming method in SNOPT, are benchmarked on the library using performance profiles. Whenever possible the methods are applied to both the nested and the Simultaneous Analysis and Design (SAND) formulations of the problem. The performance profiles conclude that general solvers are as efficient and reliable as classical structural topology optimization solvers. Moreover, the use of the exact Hessians in SAND formulations, generally produce designs with better objective function values.

  abstract = {Structural topology optimization problems are often modelled using material interpolation schemes to produce almost solid-and-void designs. The problems become non convex due to the use of these techniques. Several articles introduce continuation approaches in the material penalization parameter to reduce the risks of ending in local minima. However, the numerical performance of continuation methods has not been studied in detail. The first purpose of this article is to benchmark existing continuation methods and the classical formulation with fixed penalty parameter in structural topology optimization. This is done using performance profiles on 225 minimum compliance and 150 compliant mechanism design problems. The results show that continuation methods generally find better designs. On the other hand, they typically require a larger number of iterations. In the second part of the article this issue is addressed. We propose an automatic continuation method, where the material penalization parameter is included as a new variable in the problem and a constraint guarantees that the requested penalty is eventually reached. The numerical results suggest that this approach is an appealing alternative to continuation methods. Automatic continuation also generally obtains better designs than the classical formulation using a reduced number of iterations.},

While mathematically and computationally perhaps the most challenging, it is also economically the most rewarding design task. This review article is based on a unified formulation and covers in detail both exact, analytical methods and approximate, discretized methods of layout optimization. Although discretized solutions are unavoidable for most practical, real-world problems, only explicit analytical solutions provide (i) a reliable means for checking the validity and convergence of numerical methods and (ii) a basis for assessing the relative economy of other designs. Moreover, some of the most efficient new numerical methods of layout optimization are iterative versions of analytical methods. Particularly promising are recent extensions of the exact layout theory to multiload, multipurpose elastic systems.},

The treatment of the subject is pitched at the background of engineering researchers, and principles of mechanics are given preference to those of pure mathematics. The author hopes to provide some new insights into fundamental properties of exact optimal topologies. Combining elements of the optimal layout theory (of Prager and the author) with those of linear programming, it is concluded that for the considered problems the optimal topology is in general unique and symmetric if the loads, domain boundaries and supports are symmetric. However, in some special cases the number of optimal solutions may be infinite, and some of these may be non-symmetric. The deeper reasons for the above findings are explained in the light of the above layout theory.},

As such, rigorous simulations are required to accurately approximate the stress field. To achieve this goal, we invoke a threshold operation and mesh refinement during the optimization. We do so in an optimal fashion, by applying adaptive mesh refinement techniques that use error indicators to refine and coarsen the mesh as needed. In this way, we obtain more accurate simulations and greater resolution of the design domain. We present results in two dimensions to demonstrate the efficiency of our method.},

A component-based logic is applied on a ground mesh of structural elements (shells and beams), which was inspired by techniques of explicit topology optimization on solid elements (plane or tridimensional massive models). Geometric components, representing the layout of the stiffeners (i.e. location, shape and size), are projected onto the ground mesh, resulting in controlled sets of active beam elements. These sets constitute the structural representation of the stiffeners‚Äô layout in the optimization model, which is then used to evaluate the objective and constraint functions of the optimization problem as well as their semi-analytical sensitivities. By applying the optimization method to compliance minimization problems, we show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method and its capability to handle a typical aerospace structure, such as a space-launcher part: a stiffened cylindrical shell in presence of an access hatch.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the field of additive manufacturing (AM), often referred to as 3D printing, has seen tremendous growth and radically changed the means by which we describe valid 3D models for production. In particular, it is now conceivable to produce composite structures consisting of smoothly varying oriented anisotropic constitutive materials. In the present work, we propose a sensitivity driven method for the generation of transverse isotropic fiber reinforced structures having smooth spatially varying orientations. Our approach builds upon finite element analysis (FEA) and density-based topology optimization (TO). The local material orientations are formulated as design variables in a stiffness maximization problem, and solved with a non-convex gradient-based optimization scheme. Length-scale control is achieved through the use of filters for regularization. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to handle large-scale 3D problems with synchronous optimization of material densities and orientations yielding millions of design variables on multiple load case scenarios. The method is shown to be compatible with compliant mechanism optimization as well as local volume constraints. Finally, the approach is extended with an additional design variable dictating the ratio of anisotropy for each element, thereby delegating the choice of material type to the optimization scheme.},

In response to this, an iterative approach in which Sequential Linear Programming (SLP) is used to simultaneously solve a size and shape optimization sub-problem subject to local stress and Euler buckling constraints is proposed in this work. To accomplish this, a first order Taylor expansion for the nodal movement and the buckling constraint is derived to conform to the SLP problem formulation. At each iteration a post-processing step is initiated to map a design vector to the exact buckling constraint boundary in order to facilitate the overall efficiency. The method is verified against an exact non-linear optimization problem formulation on a range of benchmark examples obtained from the literature. The results show that the proposed method produces optimized designs that are either close or identical to the solutions obtained by the non-linear problem formulation while significantly decreasing the computational time. This enables more efficient size and shape optimization of truss structures considering practical engineering constraints.},

Examples are MEMS devices manufactured using etching processes, nano-devices manufactured using e-beam lithography or laser micro-machining and macro structures manufactured using milling processes. In the suggested robust topology optimization approach, under- and over-etching is modelled by image processing-based ‚Äúerode‚Äù and ‚Äúdilate‚Äù operators and the optimization problem is formulated as a worst case design problem. Applications of the method to the design of macro structures for minimum compliance and micro compliant mechanisms show that the method provides manufacturing tolerant designs with little decrease in performance. As a positive side effect the robust design formulation also eliminates the longstanding problem of one-node connected hinges in compliant mechanism design using topology optimization.},

The construction problem can be called an inverse problem of finding a material with given homogenized coefficients. The inverse problem is formulated as a topology optimization problem i.e. finding the interior topology of a base cell such that cost is minimized and the constraints are defined by the prescribed constitutive parameters. Numerical values of the constitutive parameters of a given material are found using a numerical homogenization method expressed in terms of element mutual energies. Numerical results show that arbitrary materials, including materials with Poisson's ratio ‚àí1.0 and other extreme materials, can be obtained by modelling the base cell as a truss structure. Furthermore, a wide spectrum of materials can be constructed from base cells modelled as continuous discs of varying thickness. Only the two-dimensional case is considered in this paper but formulation and numerical procedures can easily be extended to the three-dimensional case.},

  abstract = {Selective laser melting (SLM)-produced variable-density (VD) lattice structures are deemed a promising solution to lightweight design. However, due to the large number of cells in the structures, designing VD structures is still time-consuming and exhibits poor adaptability to external load. Therefore, in order to decrease the number of design variables in VD design, this paper proposed a modelling approach for VD lattice structures manufactured using SLM. The stress values provided by Ô¨Ånite element analysis (FEA) were grouped according to k-means clustering, where the sizes of lattice cells in the same group remain identical. Then the relative densities of cells‚Äô in all groups are obtained and the VD model is generated. By taking the design of a VD lattice beam as an example, the feasibility of the proposed method was veriÔ¨Åed by conducting FEA and three-point bending tests on SLM-produced Ti6Al4V samples, as well as using morphological observation measures. The results show that the number of design variables for reconstructing the beam was decreased from 125 to 8, and the VD samples reached the designed carrying capacity and also presented superior lightweight performance compared with their isovolumetric homogenous counterparts.},

The method is labelled Discrete Material Optimization (DMO) but uses gradient information combined with mathematical programming to solve a discrete optimization problem. The method can be used to solve the orientation problem of orthotropic materials and the material selection problem as well as problems involving both. The method relies on ideas from multiphase topology optimization to achieve a parametrization which is very general and reduces the risk of obtaining a local optimum solution for the tested conÔ¨Ågurations. The applicability of the DMO method is demonstrated for Ô¨Åbre angle optimization of a cantilever beam and combined Ô¨Åbre angle and material selection optimization of a four-point beam bending problem and a doubly curved laminated shell.

Thanks to their modular nature, they bring interesting features among which reduced tooling, fast assembly, and short repair time. In the first part of the article, we formulate an optimizing method that minimizes the mass of a cellular architectured structure taking into account internal stresses, local buckling, and pattern repetition constraints. The proposed solving algorithm mitigates the appearance of local minima, a critical problem for discrete trusses. In the second part, the optimization method is applied to a real-size aeronautic application: the minimization of the mass of a cellular 3D wing box subject to lift and torsion loads. Compared to classic cell topologies, the proposed method found a cell 10-times lighter, at the cost of increased manufacturing difficulty.},

  abstract = {Modularity, a design philosophy in which a structure is comprised of identical components called modules, offers economical advantages as the modules can be mass produced in high quality controlled facilities. Prior research investigated structural optimization as a means of improving modular design, focusing on optimizing separately (i) the module topology and the module spatial orientation or (ii) the dynamic grouping into families of different topologies. This research did not include stability despite its considerable importance during preliminary design. In this paper, a novel integrated strategy is proposed for the preliminary design of modular trusses, unifying module topology, spatial orientation, and grouping optimization, as well as stability considerations to define meaningful solutions for real-life case studies. This is addressed by formulating an appropriate mixed-variable minimum volume problem in elastic design, including multiple load cases with self-weight and stress limitations in tension and compression. Global stability is considered through a linear prebuckling constraint, and a local buckling constraint is formulated by considering Euler buckling with standard profiles obtained from commercial catalogues. The practical applicability of this contribution is demonstrated on a benchmark modular bridge and a three-dimensional modular vault structure. The importance of stability considerations is also investigated, where the redundancy introduced by modularity is shown to contribute to the global resistance of the entire structure.},

  abstract = {Modularity in structural engineering offers significant cost advantages since identical components can be mass-produced in high quality-controlled facilities. While prior research has investigated the optimization of modular structures, this work is limited to the module topology periodicity, leading to solutions where some structure parts remain inefficiently used. This paper proposes a continuum-based formulation for optimizing simultaneously the module topology and spatial orientation in modular trusses. The numerical difficulties associated with the module rotations in the optimization formulation are identified, and properly handled by a novel topology-based rotation representation using group theory. A relaxation strategy based on complementary constraints enables the continuous integration of the module rotations in a lower-bound plastic design formulation (or fully stressed design). Case studies involving high density ground structures demonstrate that it is able in the worst case to retrieve the results obtained by imposing the module orientation a priori, and to improve the optimized design when freedom on the rotations is considered.},

The next step is to perform constraint aggregation over the reformulated local constraints using a lower bound aggregation function. We demonstrate that this approach concurrently aggregates the constraints and relaxes the feasible domain, thereby making singular optima accessible. The main advantage is that no separate constraint relaxation techniques are necessary, which reduces the parameter dependence of the problem. Furthermore, there is a clear relationship between the original feasible domain and the perturbed feasible domain via this aggregation parameter.},

These lattice structures possess exceptional mechanical strength resulting in highly efficient load supporting systems when configured as the cores of sandwich panels. These same structures also provide interesting possibilities for cross flow heat exchange. In this scenario, heat is transported from a locally heated facesheet through the lattice structure by conduction and is dissipated by a cross flow that propagates through the low flow resistant pore passages. The combination of efficient thermal conduction along the lattice trusses and low flow resistance through the pore channels results in highly efficient cross flow heat exchange. Recent research is investigating the use of hollow truss structures that enable their simultaneous use as heat pipes which significantly increases the efficiency of heat transport through the lattice and their mechanical strength. The relationships between heat transfer, frictional flow losses and topology of the lattice structure are discussed and opportunities for future developments identified.},

It is worth mentioning that the equivalent properties of material microstructures serve as a link between the macro and the micro scale with the help of homogenization theory and the Porous Anisotropic Material with Penalization (PAMP) model. Besides, sensitivities of global structure compliance with respect to the pseudo-density variables and the microstructure parameter variables are derived, respectively. Moreover, several numerical examples are presented and reasonable solutions have been obtained to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

  abstract = {In this work, a novel design and modeling method is proposed to obtain hierarchical structures with non-uniform lattice microstructures based on density-based topology optimization. First of all, a parametric concept is proposed to generate a family of parameterized lattice microstructures that present similar topological features. In order to balance the structural performance and computational efficiency, we construct a Parameterized Interpolation for Lattice Material (PILM) model and the mathematical formulation incorporates two new design variables. At the macroscale, the relative density variable is applied to describe material volume fraction in the design domain, instead of using the pseudo-density in the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) model. At the microscale, each macroelement is regarded as an individual microstructure controlled by an aspect ratio variable. The equivalent properties of parameterized lattice microstructures can be derived by interpolating the effective elastic matrixes of several typical microstructure unit cells, which avoid expensive iterative homogenization calculations during optimization procedure. Hence, the multiscale concurrent design method can optimize the macroscopic distribution and their spatially varying microstructural configurations simultaneously at an affordable computation cost. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the obtained hierarchical structures with non-uniform lattice microstructures show good manufacturability and remarkably improved structural performance by means of the additive manufacturing and experimental testing, compared to the designs with uniform lattice microstructures.},

  abstract = {De-homogenization is becoming an effective method to significantly expedite the design of high-resolution multiscale structures, but existing methods have thus far been confined to simple static compliance minimization. There are two critical challenges to be addressed in accommodating general cases: enabling the design of unit-cell orientation and using free-form microstructures. In this paper, we propose a data-driven de-homogenization method that allows effective design of the unit-cell orientation angles and conformal mapping of spatially varying, complex microstructures. We devise a parameterized microstructure composed of rods in different directions to provide more diversity in stiffness while retaining geometrical simplicity. The microstructural geometry-property relationship is then surrogated by a neural network to avoid costly homogenization. A Cartesian representation of the unit-cell orientation is incorporated into homogenization-based optimization to design the angles. Corresponding high-resolution multiscale structures are obtained from the homogenization-based designs through a conformal mapping constructed with sawtooth function fields. This allows us to assemble complex microstructures with an oriented and compatible tiling pattern, while preserving the local homogenized properties. To demonstrate our method with a specific application, we optimize the frequency response of structures under harmonic excitations within a given frequency range. It is the first time that a sawtooth function is applied in a de-homogenization framework for complex design scenarios beyond static compliance minimization. The examples illustrate that multiscale structures can be generated with high efficiency and much better dynamic performance compared with the macroscale-only optimization. Beyond frequency response design, our proposed framework can be applied to other general problems.},

The result is a 3D topology optimization technique that demonstrates outstanding flexibility of handling topological changes, fidelity of boundary representation and degree of automation. We have implemented the algorithm with the use of several robust and efficient numerical techniques of level set methods. The benefit and the advantages of the proposed method are illustrated with several 2D examples that are widely used in the recent literature of topology optimization, especially in the homogenization based methods.},

For this, two sets of design variables, i.e., a density field for defining the structural layout, and a time field which determines the fabrication process order, are simultaneously optimized. These two fields allow to generate a sequence of intermediate structures, upon which manufacturing constraints (e.g., fabrication continuity and speed) are imposed. The proposed space-time formulation is general, and is demonstrated on three fabrication settings, considering self-weight of the intermediate structures, process-dependent critical loads, and time-dependent material properties.},

Geometry projection is a means to parameterize the topology optimization problem, by describing the design in a way that is independent of the mesh used for analysis of the design's performance; it results in many fewer design parameters, necessarily resolves the ill-posed nature of the topology optimization problem, and provides sharp descriptions of the material interfaces. We extend previous geometric projection work to 3 dimensions and design unit cells for lattice materials using inverse homogenization. We perform a sensitivity analysis of the geometric projection and show it has smooth derivatives, making it suitable for use with gradient-based optimization algorithms. The technique is demonstrated by designing unit cells comprised of a single constituent material plus void space to obtain light, stiff materials with cubic and isotropic material symmetry. We also design a single-constituent isotropic material with negative Poisson's ratio and a light, stiff material comprised of 2 constituent solids plus void space.},

The introduction of such architecture, which is increasingly able to be fabricated due to advances in additive manufacturing, expands the design domain and enables improved design, from the most complex multi-physics design problems to the simple compliance design problem that is our focus. Unfortunately, concurrent design of both the micro-scale and the macroscale is computationally very expensive when the former can vary spatially, particularly in three dimensions. Instead, we provide simple, accurate surrogate models of the homogenized linear elastic response of the isotruss, the octet truss, and the ORC truss based on high-fidelity continuum finite element analyses. These surrogate models are relatively accurate over the full range of relative densities, in contrast to analytical models in the literature, which we show lose accuracy as relative density increases. The surrogate models are also simple to implement, which we demonstrate by modifying Sigmund‚Äôs 99-line code to solve a three-dimensional, multiscale compliance design problem with spatially varying relative density. We use this code to generate examples in both two and three dimensions that illustrate the advantage of elastic meta-materials over structures with a single length scale, i.e., those without micro-architectures.},

  abstract = {In this review we identify a new category of methods for implementing and solving structural optimization problems that has emerged over the last 20 years, which we propose to call feature-mapping methods. The two defining aspects of these methods are that the design is parameterized by a high-level geometric description and that features are mapped onto a non-body-fitted mesh for analysis. One motivation for using these methods is to gain better control over the geometry to, for example, facilitate imposing direct constraints on geometric features, while avoiding issues with re-meshing. The review starts by providing some key definitions and then examines the ingredients that these methods use to map geometric features onto a fixed mesh. One of these ingredients corresponds to the mechanism for mapping the geometry of a single feature onto a fixed analysis grid, from which an ersatz material or an immersed-boundary approach is used for the analysis. For the former case, which we refer to as the pseudo-density approach, a test problem is formulated to investigate aspects of the material interpolation, boundary smoothing, and numerical integration. We also review other ingredients of feature-mapping techniques, including approaches for combining features (which are required to perform topology optimization) and methods for imposing a minimum separation distance among features. A literature review of feature-mapping methods is provided for shape optimization, combined feature/free-form optimization, and topology optimization. Finally, we discuss potential future research directions for feature-mapping methods.},

The macroscale optimization is accomplished using gradient-based nonlinear topological optimization. But instead of using density as the optimization decision variable, the decision variables are the multiple parameters that define the local microscale metamaterial. This is accomplished using single layer feedforward Gaussian basis function networks as a surrogate models of the elastic response of the microscale metamaterial. The surrogate models are trained using highly resolved continuum finite element simulations of the microscale metamaterials and hence are significantly more accurate than analytical models e.g. classical beam theory. Because the derivative of the surrogate model is important for sensitivity analysis of the macroscale topology optimization, a neural network training procedure based on the Sobolev norm is described. Since the SIMP method is not appropriate for spatially varying lattices, an alternative method is developed to enable creation of void regions. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated via several examples in which the optimal graded metamaterial outperforms a traditional solid structure.},

In this paper, we present a method to generate bone-like porous structures as lightweight infill for additive manufacturing. Our method builds upon and extends voxel-wise topology optimization. In particular, for the purpose of generating sparse yet stable structures distributed in the interior of a given shape, we propose upper bounds on the localized material volume in the proximity of each voxel in the design domain. We then aggregate the local per-voxel constraints by their p-norm into an equivalent global constraint, in order to facilitate an efficient optimization process. Implemented on a high-resolution topology optimization framework, our results demonstrate mechanically optimized, detailed porous structures which mimic those found in nature. We further show variants of the optimized structures subject to different design specifications, and we analyze the optimality and robustness of the obtained structures.},

  abstract = {A key requirement in 3D fabrication is to generate objects with individual exterior shapes and their interior being optimized to application-specific force constraints and low material consumption. Accomplishing this task is challenging on desktop computers, due to the extreme model resolutions that are required to accurately predict the physical shape properties, requiring memory and computational capacities going beyond what is currently available. Moreover, fabrication-specific constraints need to be considered to enable printability. To address these challenges, we present a scalable system for generating 3D objects using topology optimization, which allows to efficiently evolve the topology of high-resolution solids towards printable and light-weight-high-resistance structures. To achieve this, the system is equipped with a high-performance GPU solver which can efficiently handle models comprising several millions of elements. A minimum thickness constraint is built into the optimization process to automatically enforce printability of the resulting shapes. We further shed light on the question how to incorporate geometric shape constraints, such as symmetry and pattern repetition, in the optimization process. We analyze the performance of the system and demonstrate its potential by a variety of different shapes such as interior structures within closed surfaces, exposed support structures, and surface models.},

Bi-directional ESO (BESO) is an extension to this method and can begin with minimal amount of material (only that necessary to support the load and support cases) in contrast to ESO which uses an initially oversized structure. Using BESO the structure is then allowed to grow into the optimum design or shape by both adding elements where the stresses are the highest and taking elements away where stresses are the lowest. In conducting this research, a methodology was developed (and integrated into the ESO program EVOLVE) which produced the optimal 3D finite element models of a structure in a more reliable way than the traditional ESO method. Additionally, the BESO method was successfully extended to multiple load cases for both 2D and 3D. Two different algorithms were used to find the best structure experiencing more than one load case and the results of each are included.},

  abstract = {Topology optimization is a technique that allows for increasingly efficient designs with minimal a priori decisions. Because of the complexity and intricacy of the solutions obtained, topology optimization was often constrained to research and theoretical studies. Additive manufacturing, a rapidly evolving field, fills the gap between topology optimization and application. Additive manufacturing has minimal limitations on the shape and complexity of the design, and is currently evolving towards new materials, higher precision and larger build sizes. Two topology optimization methods are addressed: the ground structure method and density-based topology optimization. The results obtained from these topology optimization methods require some degree of post-processing before they can be manufactured. A simple procedure is described by which output suitable for additive manufacturing can be generated. In this process, some inherent issues of the optimization technique may be magnified resulting in an unfeasible or bad product. In addition, this work aims to address some of these issues and propose methodologies by which they may be alleviated. The proposed framework has applications in a number of fields, with specific examples given from the fields of health, architecture and engineering. In addition, the generated output allows for simple communication, editing, and combination of the results into more complex designs. For the specific case of three-dimensional density-based topology optimization, a tool suitable for result inspection and generation of additive manufacturing output is also provided.},

  abstract = {This work introduces an Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) strategy for the topology optimization of structures made of discrete geometric components using the geometry projection method. Practical structures made of geometric shapes such as bars and plates typically exhibit low volume fractions with respect to the volume of the design region they occupy. To maintain an accurate analysis and to ensure well-defined sensitivities in the geometry projection, it is required that the element size is smaller than the smallest dimension of each component. For low-volume-fraction structures, this leads to finite element meshes with very large numbers of elements. To improve the efficiency of the analysis and optimization, we propose a strategy to adaptively refine the mesh and reduce the number of elements by having a finer mesh on the geometric components, and a coarser mesh away from them. The refinement indicator stems very naturally from the geometry projection and is thus straightforward to implement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AMR method by performing topology optimization for the design of minimum-compliance and stress-constrained structures made of bars and plates.},

Our method renders topologies made distinctly of plates, thereby producing designs that better conform to manufacturing processes tailored to plate structures, such as those that employ stock plates that are cut and joined by various means. To force the structural members to be plates, we employ the geometry projection method to project an analytical description of a set of fixed-thickness plates onto a continuous density field defined over a 3-dimensional, uniform finite element grid for analysis. A size variable is assigned to each plate and penalized so that the optimizer can entirely remove a plate from the design. The proposed method accommodates the case where the plates in the topology are rectangular and solid, and the case where the boundaries of the plates can change and holes can be introduced. The latter case is attained by composition with a free density field. We present examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and discuss future work.},

This method is constructed under the so-called moving morphable components based solution framework. The novel aspect of the proposed method is that a set of structural components is introduced to describe the topology of a three-dimensional structure and the optimal structural topology is found by optimizing the layout of the components explicitly. The standard finite element method with ersatz material is adopted for structural response analysis and the shape sensitivity analysis only need to be carried out along the structural boundary. Compared to the existing methods, the description of structural topology is totally independent of the finite element/finite difference resolution in the proposed solution framework and therefore the number of design variables can be reduced substantially. Some widely investigated benchmark examples, in the three-dimensional topology optimization designs, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract  = {The integrated optimization of lightweight cellular materials and structures are discussed in this paper. By analysing the basic features of such a two-scale problem, it is shown that the optimal solution strongly depends upon the scale effect modelling of the periodic microstructure of material unit cell (MUC), i.e. the so-called representative volume element (RVE). However, with the asymptotic homogenization method used widely in actual topology optimization procedure, effective material properties predicted can give rise to limit values depending upon only volume fractions of solid phases, properties and spatial distribution of constituents in the microstructure regardless of scale effect. From this consideration, we propose the design element (DE) concept being able to deal with conventional designs of materials and structures in a unified way. By changing the scale and aspect ratio of the DE, scale-related effects of materials and structures are well revealed and distinguished in the final results of optimal design patterns. To illustrate the proposed approach, numerical design problems of 2D layered structures with cellular core are investigated. Copyright ¬© 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In literature, exhaustive studies have been carried out in compositional modeling and design, while limited reports are available for microstructural optimization. This article presents an inverse homogenization method for the design of two-phase (solid/void) FGM microstructures, whose periodic base cells (PBCs) vary in a direction parallel to the property gradient but periodically repeat themselves in the perpendicular direction. The effective elasticity tensor at each PBC is estimated in terms of the homogenization theory. The overall difference between the effective tensor and their target is minimized by seeking for an optimal PBC material topology. To preserve the connectivity between adjacent PBCs, three methods, namely connective constraint, pseudo load, and unified formulation with nonlinear diffusion are proposed herein. A number of two-dimensional examples possessing graded volume fraction and Young‚Äôs modulus but constant positive or negative Poisson‚Äôs ratios are presented to demonstrate this computational design procedure.},
