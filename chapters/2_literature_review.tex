Introduction

Extensively present in nature (e.g., bone-microstructure or birds beak), their research interest came thanks to the observation that the stiffness of optimal structures spans multiple scales \sidecite{kohn_optimal_1986,allaire_optimal_1999}. In addition to that, Fleck observed that \sidecite{fleck_micro-architectured_2010}~``\textit{one reason for such structural hierarchy in engineering structures is to increase buckling strength: recall that the buckling strength scales with any representative strut length $l$ according to $l^{-2}$, and so the finer the length scale, the higher the buckling strength}.''
