Introduction

\section{Optimize the modules' layout using a modified DMO algorithm}
The goal is to treat the problem of contemporanely optimizing the modules' layout and topology of a modular structure. the major scientific challange is that the layout optimization of the modules in the structure subdomains is a discrete problem, where we can't have interediate results at the end of the optimization. As we want to use a gradient descent algorithm \sidecite{sigmund_usefulness_2011} for this reason we need to find a method to transform a discrete problem into a continuous one. 

\subsection{Definition of the subdomains cross-sectional areas}
inspired by the work of stegmann and lund on the \gls{dmo} algorithm \sidecite{stegmann_discrete_2005}, we decided here to define the subdomains variables (so the variables of the structure) as a weighted sum of the modules variables. In the case of a ground structure discretized using Nsub subdomains and Nt different modules, we define then the cross sectional areas of the subdomain j as:
\begin{equation}
    \vect{a}^j = \sum_{t=1}^{N_T} w_t^j \bar{\vect{a}}_t 
\end{equation}
where $\bar{\vect{a}}_t $ represent the vector of cross sectional areas of the t module and $\vect{w}^j$ is the vector of weight relatives to the j subdomain, defined as $ \vect{w}^j \in \mathbb{R}^t\,|\,w_j^t \in [0,1]$.

An exemple of a cantilever beam with Nsub = 8 and Nt = 2 is given in \figref{fig:06_weighted_sum}, where we see how the modfication of the weight values $\vect{w}$ influences the structure topology.

\begin{figure*}

    \includegraphics{figures/06_DMO/00_weight_dmo/weight_dmo.pdf}
    \caption{}
    \label{fig:06_weighted_sum}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Variables penalization schemes}
The limit of the presented approach lies in the fact that at convergence, the weight of every subdomains mus be all zero but one to one . This is because intermediate weights would represent a mix of different topologies that would not have mechanical sense and that would prove to be impossible to manufacture. For that reason we implement here an interpolation scheme that penalize intermediate densities. We use here \gls{ramp} \sidecite{stolpe_alternative_2001} and not the more used SImp interpolation scheme as RAMP because the derivative it is never infinite nor 0 at zero density.

We define the design variable $\alpha$ responsable of the module choiche inside of the subdomain j. its relationship with the weight $w$ is the following: 
\begin{equation}
    w_t^j = \frac{\alpha_t^j}{1+p(1-\alpha_t^j)}    
\end{equation}
where $p\in \mathbb{R}^+$ is a parameter used to control the steepness of the RAMP interpolation. Additionally, inspired by the works of \sidecite{hvejsel_material_2011}, we put up a multi-phase versions of the RAMP interpolation where we simultaneously penalize mechanical properties and we artificailly icrease the volume of modules with intermediate densities. To do that we define an additional RAMP parameter, this thime always negative $q\in \mathbb{R}^-$ that is used to evaluated the increased weights associated with the evaluation of the volume $V$.
\begin{equation}
    V = \sum_{j=1}^{N_{\text{sub}}}\vect{\bar{\ell}}^T\tilde{\vect{a}}^j,
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{a}$ is defined as following:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\vect{a}}^j = \sum_{t=1}^{N_T} \tilde{w}_t^j \bar{\vect{a}}_t, 
\end{equation}
and $\tilde{w}$
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{w}_t^j = \frac{\alpha_t^j}{1+q(1-\alpha_t^j)}.    
\end{equation}
So for every design variable alpha, we associate two different weights (w and tilde w) that are used to evaluate the mechanical properties and the structure volume, respectively (see \figref{fig:06_ramp}).

\subsection{The optimization formulation and resolution algorithm}
The objective function of the optimization process is the volume minimization of the modular structure. 
The members of the structure are subject to multiple mechanical constraints, namely stress, topological buckling, minimum slenderness, and compatibility constraints. Formulation $\mathbb{M}_1$ is stated in terms of modules' cross-sectional area $\bar{\vect{a}}$, module selection variables $\vect{\alpha}$, member forces $\vect{q}$ and nodal displacements $\vect{U}$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \min_{\bar{\vect{a}}, \vect{\alpha}, \bm{q}, \bm{U}}   && V &= \sum_{j=1}^{N_{\text{sub}}}\vect{\bar{\ell}}^T\tilde{\vect{a}}^j && \textrm{(Volume minimization)}\\
    \textrm{s.t.}   && \bm{B}\bm{q} &= \bm{f} && \textrm{(Force equilibrium)}\\
                    && \bm{q} &= \frac{\bm{a}\bm{E}}{\bm{\ell}}\bm{b}^T\bm{U} && \textrm{(Compatibility constraints)} \\
                    && \bm{q} &\geq -\frac{\bm{s}\bm{a}^2}{\bm{\ell^2}} && \textrm{(Euler buckling constraints)} \\
                    && -\sigma_C\bm{a} &\leq \bm{q} \leq \sigma_T\bm{a} && \textrm{(Stress constraints)} \\
                    && \bar{\vect{a}}_{t,r}&\geq \bar{a}_{t,r=1} && r \in \mathcal{C}_{l,r}(\bar{\vect{a}}_t),\, \forall t \\
                    && 0 &\leq \bar{\vect{a}} \leq \frac{4 \pi \bar{\vect{\ell}}^2}{\lambda_{\text{max}}} && \textrm{(Slenderness limit)} \\
                    && \sum_{t=1}^{N_T} \alpha_t^j &\leq 1, \; \forall j && \textrm{(One selected module max.)} \\
    \end{aligned}
    \tag{$\mathbb{M}_1$}
    \label{eq:06_optim_complete}
\end{equation}

This formulation builds on the classic DMO approach, adding multiple mechanical constraints, operating on a ground structure, but most importantly we are not only selecting the best module for every subdomain changing the value of $\alpha$, but we are also optimizing the also the modules topology, and all of this at the same time. Tihis is more difficoult. The qvqntqges of this formulation are essentially the fact that wa are dealing with discrete problem and solving it using continuous design variables and a gradient based optimizer. However, we increase considerably the size of the problem, as we are adding numerous additional design variables $\alpha$ that scales with the number of subdomains and the number of modules.

The design variable alpha are constrained by a set of constraint that constraint the maximum sum of weights of a j submodule to one. it is important to note that we are treating this constraint as a disequality constraint and not an equality, and for this reason we give the optimizer the ability to put al the weights to zero and remove the subdomain from the steucture.
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{t=1}^{N_T} \alpha_t^j \leq 1, \; \forall j 
\end{equation}

Problem \eqrefnotext{eq:06_optim_complete} is solved using a modified version of the proposed two step solving algorithm, in wich we solve a relaxed problem without compatibility constraints kinematic compatibility constraints are omitted. We call this relaxed Problem $\mathbb{M}_2$. this time, as the problem is nonlinear due to the alpha design variables, we solve it without linearizing the buckling constraints.  here is the formulation of the first subproblem, formulated in terms of modules' cross-sectional area $\bar{\vect{a}}$, module selection variables $\vect{\alpha}$, member forces $\vect{q}$:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \min_{\bar{\vect{a}}, \vect{\alpha}, \bm{q}}   && V &= \sum_{j=1}^{N_{\text{sub}}}\vect{\bar{\ell}}^T\tilde{\vect{a}}^j && \textrm{(Volume minimization)}\\
    \textrm{s.t.}   && \bm{B}\bm{q} &= \bm{f} && \textrm{(Force equilibrium)}\\
                    && \bm{q} &\geq -\frac{\bm{s}\bm{a}^2}{\bm{\ell^2}} && \textrm{(Euler buckling constraints)} \\
                    && -\sigma_C\bm{a} &\leq \bm{q} \leq \sigma_T\bm{a} && \textrm{(Stress constraints)} \\
                    && 0 &\leq \bar{\vect{a}} \leq \frac{4 \pi \bar{\vect{\ell}}^2}{\lambda_{\text{max}}} && \textrm{(Slenderness limit)} \\
                    && \sum_{t=1}^{N_T} \alpha_t^j &\leq 1, \; \forall j && \textrm{(One selected module max.)} \\
    \end{aligned}
    \tag{$\mathbb{M}_2$}
    \label{eq:06_optim_relax}
\end{equation}

Problem m2 is solved using a gradient based optimizer that exploits iteratively the firs and second order derivative to attain convergence. The evaluation of the jacobian and the hessian matrix for this problem is detailed in \appref{app:01}

Once the problem m2 is solved, We fix the module layout on the structure $\alpha$ and we evaluate the corresponding indexes of the mapping matrix H as follows:
\begin{equation}
    h_{j,t} =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{if $\alpha_{j,t} = \max(\vect{\alpha}_{j})$} \\
      0 & \text{otherwise.} 
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Then the compatibility constraints are added again, a FEA is solved to evaluate initial displacements
we solve it fixing the submodules topology and using the VL formulation already used in \dots
we have no alpha anymore
\marginnote{Formulation ${\mathbb{M}}_\text{1}$ permits to optimize modular structures with fixed module layout. It is stated in terms of modular cross-sectional areas $\bar{\vect{a}}$, member forces $\vect{q}$ and nodal displacements $\vect{U}$ as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
    \min_{\bar{\vect{a}}, \vect{q}, \vect{U}}   && V &= \vect{\ell}^{T}\vect{a}\\
    \textrm{s.t.}  && \vect{a} &= \sum_{t=1}^{N_\text{T}} \vect{h}_t\otimes\bar{\vect{a}}_t \\ 
    && \matr{B}\vect{q} &= \vect{f} && \\
    && \vect{q} &= \frac{\vect{a}E}{\vect{\ell}}\vect{b}^T\vect{U} &&  \\
    && \vect{q} &\geq -\frac{s\vect{a}^2}{\vect{\ell}^{*2}} &&  \\
    && -\sigma_c\vect{a} &\leq \vect{q} \leq \sigma_t\vect{a} &&  \\
    && \bar{\vect{a}}_{t,r}&\geq \bar{a}_{t,r=1}\\
    && 0 &\leq \bar{\vect{a}} \leq \frac{4 \pi \bar{\vect{\ell}}^2}{\lambda_{\text{max}}}, \\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
}
\subsection{Optimization initialization: a clustering algorithm to identify similarly behaving subdomains}
we are not only changing the weights but also the modules topology.  the layout is dependent on the module topology and vice versa. It is then really difficoult for a gradient based optimizer chose where to go so we give a slighltly influenced departure point x0. In this work we decided to infuence the weight distribuition as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \alpha_{t,\text{it}=0}^j=
    \begin{cases}
        \frac{1}{N_\text{T}} \cdot 1.1  & \text{if the $j$-th subdomain has the  $t$-th module selected,}\\
        \frac{N_\text{T}-1.1}{N_\text{T}(N_\text{T}-1)} & \text{otherwise.} \\
    \end{cases}  
\end{equation}

\end{figure*}

the initial layout of modules is assessed using a k meeans clustering technique with nt clusters. Given a set of observations (x1, x2, ..., xn), where each observation is a d-dimensional real vector, k-means clustering aims to partition the n observations into n sets. we define the observation as the vector containing the FEA calculated stress distribuition on the uniform initial ground structure. Additionally we add the stress state S For the j-th submodule we define the 
\begin{equation}
    S^j=\sum_{i=0}^{\bar{n}}|\sigma^j_i|
\end{equation}
This add permits to promote the clustering of not only submodules loaded in similar ways, but also on similar magnitude (and have so more voluminous and less voluminous modules). the full process is depicted in \figref{fig:06_kmeans}, where we see how differently the clustering is conducted starting from the same starting point (the FEA calculated stress distribuition on the uniform initial ground structure) but with different number of clusters (2,3,and 5). \figref{fig:06_x0} finally shows the initial starting point of the optimization, with uniform initialization of $\bar{a}$ and the biased weight distribution based on the k means clustering.

\section{Numerical application}\label{sec:06_num_app}
All of the examples presented in this section are solved using the proposed two step formulation, where in the first step we solve a relaxed formulation (no compatibility constraints) to find the optimized modules layout and topology. later, the layout of the modules is fixed, and we solve the optimization problem again to force the structure to comply with the compatibility constraints. The formulations are solved using the non liner interior point solver IPOPT for the two optimization steps 

A continuation scheme is set up on the penalization parameter $q$ of the RAMp interpolation scheme used to evaluate the subdomain volume, where the parameter is set up at zero, and then it increase to -0.4 and -0.8 every time the (and the optimizer is not in a restoration phase). The continaution scgheme is implemented only on $q$ as IPOPT is an interior point algorithm, and increasing the $p$ parameter would put the optimizer well outside of the fesable region everi time the parameter every time it is increased, creating a less than ideal situation

The stopping criterion used for the \gls{nlp} optimizations is $\norm{\Delta_{\text{NLP}}}_\infty \leq \text{tol}_{nlp}$, with and $\text{tol}_{nlp}=10^{-8}$. $\Delta_{\text{NLP}}$ represents the scaled \gls{nlp} error, a more comprehensive value used by IPOPT to take into account the optimality of the solution and the constraints violation. The objective function is always scaled so that the initial volume is 1000, the areas are in the interval $[0,100]$, the initial forces in $[0,100]$, and the displacement in $[0,100]$ for the \gls{nlp}. Several additional parameters are used in the \gls{nlp} step for cyipopt and IPOPT:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{mu\_strategy} is set to \texttt{adaptive} 
    \item \texttt{jac\_c\_constant} is set to \texttt{yes} 
    \item \texttt{num\_linear\_variables} is set to \texttt{N}, with $N$ equal to the number of bars as the force is linear in this problem
    \item \texttt{grad\_f\_constant} is set to \texttt{yes} 
    \item \texttt{linear\_solver} is set to \texttt{pardiso}
    \item \texttt{bound\_push} is set to \texttt{1e-12}
    \item \texttt{constr\_viol\_tol} is set to \texttt{1e-6}
    \item \texttt{nlp\_scaling\_method} is set to \texttt{user-scaling}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Layout optimization of fixed modules}

    \label{fig:06_cant_BC_GS}
\end{marginfigure}
The proposed formulation is very versatile and permits to solve very different optimization problem. We start now by optimizing the most simple we can for modular structures.we want to optimize the distribution of a fixed topology cell inside a given domain, and the optimizer should only chose between having the subdomain poupulated or not. We take a single module topology that is held fixed during the optimization, so nt=1 and $\bar{a}_i=0.6,\,\forall i$. The only degree of fredoom given to the optimizer is the value of the weight w controlled by the design variable $\alpha$.

The structure that is optimized is a two dimensional cantilever beam of dimension $200x100$ with a center load of magnitude $P=1$. The optimization domain is partitioned into $24x12$ submodules on the x and y axis, respectively. Every subdomain is poupulated with a simple fully connected $2x2$ nodes ground structure as shown in \figref{fig:06_cant_BC_GS} The units of the test case are normalized and a list of the geometry and material parameters is given in \tabref{tab:06_modular_cant_data}. Additionally, in these examples buckling and compatibility constraints are relaxed for simplicity and to preserve the solution simmetry.

    \label{tab:06_modular_cant_data}
\end{margintable}

Before showing and commenting the optimization results, we presents two extreme cases that allow us to better understund and put into perspective the optimization results. first, we set up a monolithic optimization with no modular constraints and setting a maximum cross sectional area $a_\text{max}=0.6$. The optimization is performed on the same ground structure shown in \figref{fig:06_cant_BC_GS}. This results shold represent the lower bound of the optimization, representing the minimum value at wich modular optimization should tend, the closest to this value, the better. The resulting topology shows a volume $V=832.848$ and a thopology that ressembles the one that are obtained in classic topology optimization. Secondly, a we present a fully modular structure, in which all the subdomains presrnt the topology of the fixed topology module with all bars set to 0.6. In that case the structure shows a volume $V=9832.935$ and it represent the upper bound for the optimization. The topology of the fully modular structure is shown in \figref{fig:06_cant_BC_cell}.

\begin{marginfigure}

    \caption{$V=9832.935$}
    \label{fig:06_cant_BC_cell}
\end{marginfigure}

Now that we have set up the reference for better understand the optimization results, we perform the optimizations of the layout of the fixed topology module. Just for the first example we decided not to penalize intermediate weights, so $p=q=0$ and then $w=\alpha$. The optimized structure topology is shown in \figref{fig:06_fixed_module}a and \figref{fig:06_fixed_module}b, in wich we show also the weight distribution of the solution. Ath this stade, the optimized structure shows a volume $V = 1567.216$, a value that is not that far from the monolitic reference. however, this solution is non physical as many subdomains present intermediate dweights and we need to threshold the result. The thresolding value is set to 0.01, so any subdomains that have a weight w less than this value is considered empty. The result of the thresolding is presented in \figref{fig:06_fixed_module}d, in which we see that all weights are now set to 1. The resulting structure has a volume $V = 8808.671$, a very noticable increase due to the high number of intermediate weights shown by the solution of \figref{fig:06_fixed_module}b.

To solve this problem, we set up a multi-phase RAMP interpolation where we simultaneously penalize mechanical properties (using the parameter $p$) and we artificailly icrease the volume (using the parameter $q$) of modules with intermediate weights. In this optimization we set $p=8$ and $q_\text{min}=-0.8$, and a continuation scheme is used on the $q$ parameter to gradually decresase it to the minimum value as already explained in \secref{sec:06_num_app}. The optimized structure topology with penaliized intermediate weights is shown in \figref{fig:06_fixed_module}e and \figref{fig:06_fixed_module}f and it has a volume $V = 1961.175$, a \qty{25}{\percent} volume increase with respect to the unpenalized structure. however we can clearly see how this solution present way less subdomains with intermediate weight and this is very reflected after the thresolding phase, in wich the volume is now $V=$, more thatn \qty{60}{\percent} less than the unpenalized structure. the difference between the structure of fig and fig could also be less , as in this case we see that the subdomains creates beams tat are made by only an elements and it is enough to transfer the loads. a finer subdivision of the initial structure could then beneficial.
