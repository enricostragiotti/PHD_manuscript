\chapter{Optimizing modular structures}
Introduction
\section{Formulation of a modular structure optimization algorithm}
intro there are different type of approach that we could use, full scale and multiscale

intro multiscale.

numerical homogenization

intro full scale

the problem on the number of subsections needed to correctly foresee the mechanical behaviour
\subsection{Variable linking}
we link different domains toghether

math formulation used, talk already about the possibility to use diffeernt cells

number of design variables is low, buth still high constraints
\subsection{Topological buckling of modular structures}
\subsection{Sensitivity analysis}
how the sensitivity is changed with respect to the variable linking

just a sum more to do for constraints

\todo{image for sensitivity ?}
\section{Numerical application}
\todo{find some litterature case that we can use to compare at least visually, maybe the sandwich structure that joseph suggested me}
\subsection{On the equivalence of multi load cases and modular structures}
comparison with the literature
\todo{redo for images with the good colors}
\subsection{Parametric study on the number, the shape, and the complexity of the module}

\todo{use blender to generate images}

\todo{check always the number of design variables, constraints and time}

\todo{different tables for every parametric study with iteration count}
Simply supported 3D beam
\section{Conclusion}
